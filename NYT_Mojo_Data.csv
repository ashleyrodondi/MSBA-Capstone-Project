Nevertheless, this documentary generates ample tension as it views the last Election Day through the eyes of more than 16 people, following them during their mornings and afternoons then waiting with them for the results that night.
The diverse group includes Anthony, a former prisoner in Alabama, exonerated and voting for the first time in decades; Eric, a coal miner, and his family in West Virginia; Johnny, a union leader in Philadelphia; Calene, a mother of six in Utah who is supporting an independent presidential candidate; and others from California, Ohio and elsewhere.
We watch them at barber shops, playgrounds and dinner tables, and hear political opinions that seem prescient or misguided in retrospect. When the polls close, emotions roller coaster as the confident turn frustrated and the uncertain become enthusiastic. Many of these voters’ decisions are based on seemingly incomplete information and broad generalities. Some of their outlooks are naïve, others inspiring.
Eighteen directors are credited with the footage; Jeff Deutchman, who is listed as the curator, previously curated “11/4/08,” an examination of that Election Day. The editing here, by Jon Lefkovitz and Martha Shane, sets a speedy pace and keeps the focus on the voters rather than on Clinton and Trump, who are seldom seen.
Considering all that’s been written and said over the last year, there’s not much new to learn from “11/8/16.” But the film remains engaging for its stories, and is likely to be more instructive in the future, when passions have cooled.

Though ruthlessly romanticized and swimming in Holocaust-drama clichés — like the pallidly venomous Nazi interrogator — the story of how Georg Elser (an endearing Christian Friedel) transformed from mischievous ladies’ man to determined bomb maker is worth the telling. And for a while, it’s even quite gripping as we watch Elser painstakingly plant his intricate device in a vast beer hall in Munich where Hitler is to speak.
As directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, however, Elser’s capture and lengthy questioning by the Gestapo is a wasted opportunity to illuminate the mind of a man whom historical accounts variously describe as apolitical yet deeply concerned with workers’ rights. Bucolic flashbacks to lakeside picnics, where ripe young women vie for Elser’s floppy-haired attentions and accordion serenades, reveal little about his beliefs or ambitions. Neither does his awkward incursion into the dismal marriage of his lover (Katharina Schüttler) and her sozzled husband.
As it happens, the movie’s most compelling interaction is between Elser and a cautious police chief played by the admirable Burghart Klaussner, who achieves more with pursed lips and lowered eyelids than most actors manage with a page of dialogue. It’s a performance that leaves space for nuanced interpretation — something that the rest of this overly conventional picture sorely lacks.
With a little more shading and originality, “13 Minutes” might have pushed beyond its familiar Nazi tropes to shape something more immediate and infinitely more potent: an ominous portrait of radicalization." 0.473756031 "Biography" "R" "Sony Classics" "" "$5,763 " "$11,562 " "$24,387 " "1" "21-Mar-08" "26-Jun-08" "42" 6

The stationmaster bicycles ahead of them to issue a warning at the watering hole; the residents begin to whisper. It’s the wedding day of the son of the town clerk, who doesn’t want any trouble with elections coming up. The wedding itself seems like a shaky affair, with an uneasy groom and a bride whose previous fiancé is still hovering.
Ferenc Torok’s lean, suggestive Hungarian feature, “1945,” shot in gorgeous, high-contrast black-and-white, is a Holocaust film built, consciously or not, on a reversal of the tropes of the western, down to ticking clocks that might as well be nearing high noon. The visiting men in black hats — a father (Ivan Angelus) and his adult son (Marcell Nagy) — aren’t villains out for revenge, but Orthodox Jews, who have come to the village at the end of the war. They are transporting trunks said to be filled with perfume or cosmetics. The purpose of their journey is obscure.
The two barely speak over the course of the film; the guilty villagers talk among themselves. “We have to give it all back,” the town drunk (Jozsef Szarvas) tells the clerk, Istvan (Peter Rudolf), believing that the strangers have a connection to the town’s deported Jews. Dismissing the concern, Istvan nevertheless understands that fear; he played a pivotal role in betraying the local Jews, a sin for which his opiate-addicted wife (Eszter Nagy-Kalozy) holds him in contempt. As the film slowly reveals how the village’s veneer of civility is built over a foundation of treachery, the darkened foregrounds suggest conspirators hiding in plain sight.
Absorbing and finely wrought, “1945” is not perfect. It oversimplifies Istvan’s motivation for issuing an accusation against a friend. The modernist-style score by Tibor Szemzo is more distracting than atmospheric, especially when it riffs on Max Bruch’s widely used composition for Kol Nidre, a Yom Kippur prayer that seems inappropriate for this particular context. And by design, the movie is something of a tease, more interested in setup than in payoff.

"4" "20th Century Women" "1/20/2017" "12/27/2016" "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/movies/review-20th-century-women.html" 1 "Love and loss go hand in hand in “20th Century Women,” a funny, emotionally piercing story about a teenager and the women who raise him. It opens in 1979, when cool kids danced to Talking Heads (“This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco”) and President Carter bummed everyone out talking about our “crisis of confidence.” There’s something in the air — or so it seems, although the California light here tends to blot out the shadows. When a car bursts into flames soon after the movie opens, it looks about as threatening as an art installation. Apocalypse later, man.
The car belongs to Dorothea Fields — a thrilling Annette Bening — a divorced single mom with an only son, the teenage Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann, in a heartbreakingly sincere turn). Mother and child live in Santa Barbara, that drowsy, well-heeled coastal city north of Los Angeles. There, Dorothea is raising Jamie in a roomy, stately 1905 fixer-upper that she’s renovating with the help of a boarder, William (Billy Crudup). Another lodger, an artist, Abbie (Greta Gerwig), helps keep their communal life jumping, as does Jamie’s friend Julie (Elle Fanning), who likes to cuddle platonically with him at night, sharing secrets as he tries to keep his hormones and body from betraying him.
The writer-director Mike Mills’s last movie, “Beginners,” was a lightly comic, fictionalized weepie about his father, who came out of the closet in his mid-70s when his son was an adult. Now Mr. Mills has turned to his mother, in another fictionalized story, moistened with tears, that draws on his life. This time, though, he has turned back the clock for a portrait of his mother as she was when he was a teenager and didn’t yet entirely grasp her extraordinariness. Whether she was as remarkable as the woman onscreen seems entirely beside the point — “20th Century Women” is a memory movie, one in which people are conjured up to bump against the larger world, exuberantly and uneasily.
The personal is the political, as second-wave feminists liked to say, and so it is in “20th Century Women.” The politics sneak up on you, filtered through the intimate lives of its electrically alive characters. Jamie is the story’s hub, the center from which everything and everyone ostensibly radiates, but Dorothea is its reason for being. She sets the pieces into place and motion; she’s the inspiration and guiding spirit, the story’s balm and soul. She’s also the one who, after Jamie lands in the hospital after a heart-leaping, foolish stunt, enlists Abbie and Julie to help raise Jamie. Dorothea’s a with-it mom, from tousled hair to Birkenstocked toe, but she’s also unsettled by the world.
Abbie and Julie assume their responsibilities seriously. Julie, who smokes like a Frenchwoman and reads Judy Blume, shares battle stories and wounds from the sexual front. Abbie gives Jamie records and books, including “Our Bodies, Ourselves,” that liberatory classic about women’s health and sexuality. It’s as eye-opening for Jamie as “Sisterhood Is Powerful,” the radical feminist anthology that he first opens with almost spiritual reverence — or is it trepidation? (Later, when he explains the female orgasm to an acquaintance, one of those playground braggarts, the other guy pummels him.) Jamie’s sentimental education is also a kind of encounter session.
It’s a witty and loose coalition of like minds, complete with skateboarding, dancing, loving and lived-in talk. A lot of that chatter is humorous — often gentle and wry, on rare occasion uproarious — but there’s also a powerful undertow of loss running through the movie. There are sorrows and tragedies, one involving a story thread that allows Ms. Gerwig to root around in grief and a scene in which she uncomfortably, hilariously, clears the room. For her part, Ms. Fanning drifts in and out like a dream (Jamie’s and Mr. Mills’s), a magnificent emissary from that seductive land called Young and Beautiful. You simultaneously see the girl Julie is and the girl that she’s on the verge of leaving behind.
For a memoirist, Mr. Mills is uncommonly generous. Abbie, Julie and William, who sexily floats around the periphery (Mr. Crudup is superb at not quite stealing his scenes), are so persuasively detailed that all three could spin off into a separate movie; each has both sting and tenderness nearing grace. Yet these three and even Jamie pale next to Dorothea, who’s satisfyingly complex, especially for a movie mother. Dorothea is at once laid back and uptight, which Ms. Bening conveys with moments of shambling, gestural looseness and sudden emotional spikiness. She floods the screen with warmth, threatens to burn the joint down and, with Mr. Mills, turns contradictions into character.
Mr. Mills roots around Dorothea’s unease but never quite figures it or her out, which deepens the movie. People are mysterious and parents are too, partly because you never really catch up to them. So you take stock, stare at family photographs and sift through mementos. Mr. Mills does something similar narratively as he samples the era’s music, signposts and shards, all while circling Dorothea. Fittingly, given the title, in “20th Century Women,” he also situates her in history. (The character is named after the photographer Dorothea Lange.) “My mom was born in 1924,” Jamie says in voice-over early, as the screen fills with black-and-white footage of period despair. Those ghostly images stick with you, even after the story lightens. Mr. Mills has worked in graphic design and as a music-video director, and while setting up the story he folds in snapshot-like scenes from Jamie and Dorothea’s origin stories, from a ravishing oceanic opening shot to her Depression roots, him as a grasping newborn infant and Gerald Ford stumbling. There’s a kind of restlessness in the way these images pile up, to the movie’s accumulation of album covers, its books, snatches of jazz and glimpses of Humphrey Bogart making love to Ingrid Bergman. It’s as if Mr. Mills were riffling through an encyclopedia, searching for the perfect entry, which he’s creating before your eyes." 0.999906952 "Comedy" "R" "A24" "" "" "$5,664,764 " "" "4" "2-Jun-89" "26-Jun-89" "" NA

This feature debut of the writer and director Jérôme Reybaud opens with a baby-faced 30-something, Pierre (Pascal Cervo), training a phone flashlight on his lover Paul (Arthur Igual). He then leaves Paul’s Paris apartment and drives an Alfa Romeo into rural France. The fantasy of walking out on your life and aimlessly wandering around can beguile even the most contentedly domesticated among us.
Pierre is also looking to quench a thirst. He regularly checks his Grindr app, and at a roadside restroom, scans the stall graffiti and calls a number advertising sex services. He also picks up people along the roadside, not for cruising purposes, but to be of help. The first is a middle-age woman who is booked to sing at a senior home. The characters encountered are a bit more colorful than the ones you are likely to come across in real life, but not so much that they seem overtly allegorical. As Pierre roams, Paul embarks on a quest of his own, traveling to the center of the country to look for his lover via concentric Grindr circles.
Some of this story is mildly whimsical, and there are ramps into some kind of magical realism (a blizzard at the French-Italian border is a little far-fetched). There are a lot of shots from behind a car windshield. These are more allied with Vincent Gallo’s “The Brown Bunny” than with Monte Hellman’s more lyrical “Two-Lane Blacktop.” While Mr. Reybaud has exemplary artistic confidence and an interesting vision, this is a movie that in many ways defines or justifies the “not for everybody” critical hedge." 0.538835086 "Comedy" "Unrated" "Cinema Guild" "" "$2,798 " "$38,960 " "$37,059,000 " "1,249" "21-Nov-86" "" "" NA

In the lulls between bouts of yammering, however, the director, Johannes Roberts, concentrates on building a solid atmosphere of desperation as a winch accident deposits the women unceremoniously on the ocean floor. Captured by Mark Silk’s darting camera, and in water so clouded that the computer-generated predators more than pass visual muster, their misadventures are casually entertaining.
Less so are the movie’s slapdash setup and paper-thin characterizations. Lisa (the appealing Mandy Moore), is a recent dumpee who’s eager to prove to her ex that she’s not nearly as boring as he believes. Her younger sister, Kate (Claire Holt), is merely the free spirit who goads Lisa into the water. Above them, an improbably cast Matthew Modine plays the captain of a boat so sketchy looking that it’s a wonder any of his passengers make it back to shore.
Shot in gigantic water tanks outside London and in the Dominican Republic, “47 Meters Down” — despite a clever final section — struggles to extract tension from clamor and agitation. Mr. Roberts should have studied Chris Kentis’s 2004 frightener, “Open Water,” which coaxed throat-closing dread from little more than a silent horizon and a diver’s legs waving below the surface like fronds of seaweed.

(The unrelated Iran hostage crisis was unfolding in Tehran at the time.)
From a structural standpoint, what is interesting about this dramatization of events is that it only occasionally strays from the vantage points of those on the outside. That puts the viewer in the shoes of the government officials and other onlookers as they weigh various options — loading the hostage-takers onto a bus to Heathrow Airport and raiding the bus, entering the embassy through a skylight — for ending the situation.
The factions are accorded one major actor apiece: Mark Strong is an inspector with a police negotiations team, Abbie Cornish is a BBC News reporter, Jamie Bell is a member of Britain’s Special Air Service and Tim Pigott-Smith (who died in April) is William Whitelaw, Britain’s home secretary. Over the phone, Mr. Strong’s character builds trust with the gunmen’s leader (Ben Turner). The last thread most compels the director, Toa Fraser, to violate the strictures on perspective.
With a barrage of title-card identifications, “6 Days” can feel closer to a re-enactment than a thriller. To the extent that the movie has a political angle, it’s perhaps gratuitously jingoistic.

Add the magnificent Christine Baranski to the mix and “A Bad Moms Christmas,” while still a slog of base sight gags and lazy profanity, becomes marginally more bearable.
Only marginally, given that this pitiful follow-up to last year’s “Bad Moms” is even less able to distinguish between crass and comedic. (To the writers and directors, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, they’re apparently the same thing.) Adding an extra schmear of bad mothers, the plot finds our three originals (Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Ms. Hahn) buckling under the stress of Christmas and appalled when their own mothers (played by Ms. Baranski, Cheryl Hines and Susan Sarandon) show up for the holiday.
The new arrivals, complete with a single neurosis apiece — the grifter, the clinger, the perfectionist — infantilize and infuriate their daughters, who vow to “take back Christmas.” This rebellion, staged in raucous montages in a mall and elsewhere, involves getting plastered at the food court, terrorizing Santa with cleavage and assaulting strangers and one another. Worst of all is an extended sequence where Ms. Hahn’s character gives a Brazilian wax to a prodigiously endowed male client, who verbally guides us from stem to stern with disgusting specificity. At the same time, the movie’s presumably normally gifted men are as superfluous to the proceedings as a thesaurus in the writers’ room.
Set in a suburban nightmare of oppressive expectations, “A Bad Moms Christmas” ends with its own sequel already cued up.

Ever since the screening, I’ve been wondering about those slithery creatures, which you may have noticed in the trailers and the posters, where a bunch of them share a bathtub with Mia Goth, one of the movie’s stars.
Not wondering in the “What does it mean?” sense, mind you. Anyone who has even a slight acquaintance with Freudian theory or Japanese erotica will grasp the psychosexual significance of those eels, who live in the aquifer underneath an Alpine spa and occasionally make their way into the plumbing and beyond. My questions are of a more basic nature: How did they get down there in the first place? Are they an invasive species or part of the native ecosystem? What evolutionary process might account for their curiously symbiotic relationship with the spa’s human residents?
It would be unfair to blame the director, Gore Verbinski, or the screenwriter, Justin Haythe, for declining to provide a thorough explanation. “A Cure for Wellness” defiantly and splendidly flouts the tenets of plausibility and coherence, which have never interested Mr. Verbinski very much. His résumé, after all, includes “The Lone Ranger” (also written by Mr. Haythe), “Rango” and, most notably, the first three “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies. He comes by his knack for enjoyable nonsense as honestly as his taste for aquatic fauna.
The eels may be the key to the puzzle posed by his latest project, or they may be (forgive me) a red herring. Maybe it would be best to drop the piscatory metaphors altogether. “A Cure for Wellness” is a lustrous box of genre candy, the self-revealing work of an auteur who has laid bare not so much his psyche as his online streaming queue. To watch this movie is, above all, to make a list of all the other movies it evokes, sometimes with a literalness that treads the boundary between homage and outright plagiarism.
You will notice a lot of Martin Scorsese’s “Shutter Island” here, as a dogged young man (Dane DeHaan) makes his way through an asylum-like complex of buildings in search of answers, only to become ever more deeply ensnared in the place’s sinister mysteries. You may also catch echoes of Paolo Sorrentino’s “Youth” in the mountain rest-cure setting, the weary disdain for modern life and the visual voluptuousness. Mr. Verbinski doesn’t so much observe shiny surfaces and opulent furnishings as caress them, sending a frisson of visual delight through his camera as it glides down corridors and soars over wooded glades.
There’s a bit of Guillermo del Toro’s “Crimson Peak” in the exuberant gothic creepiness, especially as the plot moves from corporate thriller to psychological melodrama to full-on creep show, complete with incest, medical experiments and ghoulish aristocratic shenanigans. And while these recent movies are the most obvious and distracting influences, an intrepid viewer will pick up hints of Hitchcock and Kubrick (and also, but only at the very end, of Spielberg), of “Suspiria” and Mario Bava.
It’s all in good fun, really, though two and a half hours may be more of this kind of fun than a body can stand. You might feel like you’re in the company of a manic cinephile friend breathlessly recounting his favorite movie scenes in no particular order. You admire his devotion, his taste and his scholarship, but in the end the experience is probably more satisfying for him than it is for you.
Still, the company isn’t bad. Mr. DeHaan brings an air of curdled innocence that inspires an interesting ambivalence. You sort of root for his character, a Wall Street hotshot named Lockhart, but you also kind of hope he suffers, since he’s a selfish, ill-mannered jerk. Dispatched by his bosses to retrieve an executive who has vanished in Switzerland, Lockhart, who is haunted by memories of his father’s suicide, finds himself in the company and eventually the care of Dr. Volmer (Jason Isaacs), a suave Continental with unnervingly impeccable manners. Mr. Isaacs is the kind of silken, charismatic villain that you can’t wait to see again.
More plot summary would be an offense against Mr. Verbinski’s demented inventiveness. Lockhart also encounters a curious elderly patient (Celia Imre), a heavy-eyed limo driver (Ivo Nandi), a tavern full of hostile young locals and a dreamy girl named Hannah (Ms. Goth, looking like a ’70s fantasy hybrid of Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek). There are clues and false leads, shocking discoveries and bouts of talking-bad-guy exposition, narrow escapes and fights to the death. And those eels, of course. You’ll figure it all out for yourself, or not. In any case, the moral of the story turns out to be a bit of advice often given to travelers: Don’t drink the water." 0.989199518 "Mystery" "R" "Fox" "$40,000,000 " "$4,356,941 " "$8,106,986 " "" "730" "7-Nov-86" "" "" NA
"10" "A Ghost Story" "7/7/2017" "7/5/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/movies/review-a-ghost-story.html" 1 "For perfectly good reasons, the literature of grief dwells on the experiences of the living, the survivors who grapple with the pain of loss and the puzzle of absence. But maybe the dead have feelings, too. That, when you think about it, is the premise of a great many ghost stories, and also of “A Ghost Story,” David Lowery’s ingenious and affecting new film.
The specter whose story this is — let’s call him Ghostie, since even when he’s alive we never learn his name — indulges in some of the usual haunting behaviors. He knocks books off shelves, makes light bulbs flicker, opens closet doors in the middle of the night and subjects a terrified family to a full-scale, crockery-smashing supernatural tantrum.
The effect of all of this on the viewer is strange and intense but not exactly scary in the expected horror-movie manner. In an age of expanded, digitally enabled ectoplasmic possibility, Mr. Lowery takes a tried-and-true, low-tech, Halloween-costume approach. Ghostie is a bedsheet with eyeholes. Possibly with some digital enhancement, but basically a 6-year-old’s idea of a ghost. And why not? We intuit his moods through the drape and droop of the fabric (the thread count looks pretty decent), and infer a brooding, smoldering temperament behind the cloth. This may be because the person inside — or at least the person Ghostie used to be — is Casey Affleck.
Before his transformation into the title character, Mr. Affleck and Rooney Mara — her character is also unnamed — live together in a ranch house in the middle of somewhere. They argue a little about moving, but otherwise they pursue a low-key, harmonious, semi-bohemian existence. He writes songs and experiments with sound. She goes off to work in the morning. They whisper and look gorgeous and occasionally exchange tender, tentative smiles. In some ways these two (and the other human beings who show up from time to time) are the real ghosts in the story — abstract, almost theoretical creatures floating in and out of Ghostie’s troubled consciousness.
The couple’s brief time together sets a hushed, poignant tone and establishes the dramatic and emotional limits within which “A Ghost Story” will operate. Not that there aren’t jolts and surprises. Just when you think you’ve cracked the film’s circumscribed logic, it opens up and goes wild in ways at once too wondrous and too preposterous to spoil. As a metaphysician, Mr. Lowery is not hung up on rules, but as a storyteller and an orchestrator of emotional effects he appreciates the need for coherence.
Ghostie is not the only one of his kind in the movie. The dead (at least some of them) can communicate directly with one another and passive aggressively with the living. They can travel in time but not in space, which explains the existence of haunted houses. They witness our suffering and fear but have only the most limited ability to intervene, even though they seem to inhabit, albeit invisibly, the same physical world we do. After a while, Ghostie’s sheet starts looking rumpled and dirty. It’s the only one he has, and he’s been wearing it for a very long time.
And time — the ways it can accelerate through years, freeze in moments and defy measurement altogether — is Mr. Lowery’s chief preoccupation here, his major theme and his raw material. At one point, early in her bereavement, Ms. Mara comes home to find a pie left for her by a well-meaning acquaintance. As Ghostie looks on, she takes a few forkfuls and then slumps down against a cabinet and keeps eating, without haste but also without pausing for breath. The camera stays on her for several minutes, which feels like an eternity. Eternity, though, is poor Ghostie’s problem.
For him the calendar and the clock have no meaning, and as the film proceeds, growing darker and stranger, we feel his impatience and disorientation. What we don’t feel is the boredom that must surely be part of the story of his long afterlife. “A Ghost Story” is suspenseful, dourly funny and at times piercingly emotional. Daniel Hart’s musical score is full of pathos and longing, compensating — maybe almost overcompensating — for the literal deadpan of the protagonist.
The movie may be built around a conceptual gimmick, but it feels less self-conscious than Mr. Lowery’s other recent films, the gloomy Southern crime story “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints” (also starring Mr. Affleck and Ms. Mara) and the sweet, borderline-twee remake of the ’70s children’s weepie “Pete’s Dragon.” “A Ghost Story” works so well because it shouldn’t work at all. Starting with a quote from Virginia Woolf, it wears its literary pedigree on its sleeve, yet it manages to feel fresh and inventive rather than stale or studied. It’s like an old tale by Saki or Henry James read for the first time: hair-raising and clever, a tour de force of sensation and a triumph of craft.
Movies these days are abuzz with all kinds of paranormal activity, most of it aimed at delivering easy, superficial terror. The scariest scene in “A Ghost Story” may be the most human, when a random guy at a party won’t stop talking about the meaningless of existence in an indifferent universe. Dude, we know! Shut up! Ghostie’s silence at that moment speaks volumes, and his inscrutable presence is a reminder that fright may be an unjust, irrational response to him and his kind.

A PG-13 rating is sometimes an overreaction to a curse word or two, but here it’s a useful caution.
The central human character is a 12-year-old, Conor O’Malley (Lewis MacDougall), who as the movie opens is having one heck of a nightmare: He and his mother (Felicity Jones) are in a churchyard as the ground begins collapsing around them, and she is in danger of being sucked away into an abyss. No subtlety or pussyfooting around here; we soon learn that the mother is fatally ill and in the midst of a drawn-out death.
If the opening moments are striking, what comes next is even more so: Conor’s imagination calls forth a monstrous yew tree that talks in the voice of Liam Neeson. It is one impressive cinematic creation, and it leads Conor on a journey intended to help him confront the realities he faces and his innermost thoughts about them.
Those realities, by the way, do not merely involve his dying mother. He is being bullied at school. He has issues with his father (Toby Kebbell), who left the family years ago and started another far away. His grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) wants him to come live with her, but he finds her cold and off-putting.
That’s a lot to load onto one boy — too much, really. The story (by Patrick Ness, from an idea by Siobhan Dowd) seems to be trying to check every box on the Things That Might Trouble a Child list, when really “dying parent” is quite enough.
To “overstuffed” you could also add “overblown.” Yes, children can have vivid imaginations, but Conor’s visions seem almost too big for his preteen head, an inner kiddie landscape as dreamed up by a special-effects studio.
That said, the film, directed by J. A. Bayona, certainly dares to be darker and more substantial than the average family movie. The monster, who Conor soon realizes is there to help, not harm him, tells the boy three stories, none of them delivering pat messages or answers. It’s a short course in the complexities and contradictions of life.
“There is not always a good guy, Conor O’Malley,” the tree tells him at one point, “nor is there always a bad one.”
The goal is to induce Conor to tell his own story — that is, to admit to himself what he really feels and wants. When he finally does — Mr. MacDougall is quite good, by the way — a climactic scene more frightening than all the ones before brings the boy some closure, or at least some understanding of how to cope with a world that can be harsh.
It’s a catharsis painted with bold, noisy imagery, one that makes death an overwhelming tsunami. If you prefer to view dying as a natural part of life, a step in a cycle, this film will feel discordant and perhaps counterproductive. But visually it will certainly stick with you, and your children." 0.900107479 "Drama" "PG-13" "Focus Features" "" "" "$3,740,823 " "" "24" "29-Nov-13" "16-Jan-14" "49" 7

The plot has a factual basis: the relationship between a German TV journalist, Jürgen Hinzpeter, and the cabdriver who drove him from Seoul to the locked-down city of Gwangju, at the time a hotbed of pro-democracy student rebellion and violent repression. While the real-life name of the cabby and his ultimate fate are unclear (his name may have been Kim Sa-bok), the film calls him Kim Man-seob and gives him a poignant back story and destiny.
Kim (Song Kang-ho) is a garrulous if gruff widowed father to an 11-year-old girl, impatient with traffic jams resulting from protests in Seoul. If it weren’t for the back rent he owes, he wouldn’t need to take Hinzpeter (Thomas Kretschmann) to the besieged Gwangju. But when he does, they witness a huge street demonstration that is met with tear gas and military brutality. The soft-spoken Hinzpeter is determined to smuggle footage of the dictatorship’s abuses to a German news organization, while the heretofore neutral Kim comes to realize the urgency of Hinzpeter’s mission.
The film climaxes with a breathless escape from Gwangju, as Kim and Hinzpeter elude government vehicles with the aid of other cabdrivers. But most impressive is Mr. Song, who persuasively conveys a working stiff’s political awakening." 0.566176481 "Action" "Unrated" "Well Go USA" "" "$331,854 " "$1,527,829 " "" "41" "14-Jun-02" "10-Oct-02" "" NA
"13" "A United Kingdom" "2/10/2017" "2/9/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/movies/review-a-united-kingdom-with-love-that-tested-racial-tolerance.html" 1 "Addressing a world that is still (even after the precedent set by the presidency of Barack Obama) increasingly afflicted by institutionalized racism and all manner of bigotries, “A United Kingdom” looks back to mid-20th-century history to create a love-conquers-much-if-not-all tale of interracial marriage and international politics.
The story is of Seretse Khama, heir to the kingship of an African people, who was attending school in Britain during the late 1940s. At a church dance, Seretse, played by David Oyelowo, meets Ruth Williams (Rosamund Pike). The two eye each other warily as the band bleats. He asks her if she likes jazz; she insists she does, only not as she’s ever heard any British musicians play it. Soon they are swapping 78s by mail, and dating. One night he kneels to propose.
There are, of course, complications. A good number of them are predictable, but they go deeper than a viewer unfamiliar with their story might have expected. Seretse’s homeland, Bechuanaland (now Botswana), an African protectorate under British control, sits directly above South Africa, which in the late 1940s was instituting the murderous policy of apartheid. The British, therefore, were deeply invested in not alienating South Africa’s rulers. And Seretse’s uncle is not keen on the returning king bringing home a white queen.
For all the tumult surrounding them, the couple remain the focus of the film. The director, Amma Asante (working from a script by Guy Hibbert, who adapted Susan Williams’s 2006 nonfiction book “Colour Bar”), emphasizes this in her staging of the unequivocal and unaffected affection and regard they exchange.
Here, as with her 2014 feature, “Belle,” Ms. Asante addresses contemporary concerns via period romance, and her commitment to the romance is not a feint. At one point the movie shows political unrest churning into violence, and juxtaposes that with a scene of the pregnant Ruth going into labor. Were you to bet that the movie would follow the childbirth thread, you would win.
This is also a very polite film. When, in a moment of frustration, Seretse swipes his arm across his desktop, knocking papers off it, Ms. Asante cuts before a single sheet, or any other object, hits the floor. For all that, the movie depicts the appalling political gamesmanship that conspires to keep Seretse and Ruth apart (including, in a shocking twist, a betrayal by a historical figure who’s almost exclusively lauded in pop-culture portrayals) with consistent clarity. And while her filmmaking style can sometimes come across as staid, her sense of pace is always acute.
The best reason to see “A United Kingdom,” however, is the performance by Mr. Oyelowo, who is also one of the film’s producers. As written by Mr. Hibbert, Seretse Khama is a character of stock wisdom and nobility — on introduction, practically his first words are “I see an Africa that’s about unity, inclusion and equality.” But Mr. Oyelowo, who is one of the best actors working today onstage or onscreen, imbues his portrayal of Seretse (who in 1966 became the democratically elected president of the independent Botswana) with a disarming delicacy and vulnerability that make the strengths he is later forced to show all the more convincing. It is remarkable, genuinely riveting work.
The other actors are also very fine for the most part: Ms. Pike’s Ruth conveys a commanding intelligence, and Vusi Kunene and Terry Pheto are two different kinds of proud in portraying Seretse’s disapproving kin. (Tom Felton, as an underhanded British bureaucrat, seems to be hard pressed to avoid twirling his waxed mustache, on the other hand.) But it’s Mr. Oyelowo who truly makes “A United Kingdom” a deeper, more rewarding film." 0.988863974 "Biography" "PG-13" "Fox Searchlight" "" "$66,510 " "$3,902,185 " "" "2" "30-Jun-00" "" "" NA

For Anna (Maggie Siff), the 44-year-old star of a popular, long-running television series in Los Angeles, burnout is imminent. Weakened by an autoimmune disease and weary of her brittle character, she abandons the series and returns to New York City to reconnect with the friends and collaborators who helped spark her career. But a lot can happen in two decades, and Anna is about to learn that the bits of ourselves we leave behind can’t always be reclaimed.
“I feel like you want something from me,” remarks Kate (Cara Seymour), welcoming yet wary. At 50, Kate is no longer an actor and is facing financial and other crises of her own. As is Isaac (John Ortiz), a playwright and the third member of their former theater group. With a teetering marriage and vague future, the gentle Isaac could have seemed a mere go-between for his two circling friends; but Mr. Ortiz is so quietly compelling that he makes Isaac’s modest ambitions feel improbably consequential.
Touching on issues of artistic survival and the porous boundary between work and pleasure, Ms. Subrin, an accomplished visual artist and filmmaker, sifts addiction, celebrity and the plight of the aging actress into something rarefied yet real. A strong, intelligent screen presence, Ms. Siff can make the simplest line feel pregnant with possibility. And Ms. Seymour is the perfect counterpoint, giving Kate a warm vulnerability that’s never overplayed or milked for sentiment.
In the hands of lesser performers — and in defiance of Chris Dapkins’s clear, bright cinematography — this debut feature would feel unbearably hermetic, its navel-gazing angst wearyingly indulgent. The slighting of women in the entertainment industry (one of Ms. Subrin’s central concerns) has been explored in multiple ways in a variety of venues. Yet, as Ms. Siff demonstrates in her own career (she’s currently enjoying her second season as a rivetingly inscrutable performance coach on Showtime’s “Billions”), television now has no shortage of challenging roles for women. Whatever their age.
So to have Anna, a television actress, bemoan the confines of her industry creates an unfortunate disjunct that weakens the narrative and lessens our sympathy. For that reason, “A Woman, a Part” is most effective when picking at the rivalries and resentments that can bloom among longtime friends, illustrating the chasm between our memories and theirs. That void opens slowly, but if you’re patient, it might just pull you in." 0.966482489 "Drama" "Unrated" "Strand" "" "$1,869 " "$6,921 " "$20,625,923 " "2,642" "29-Aug-08" "23-Oct-08" "56" 8
"15" "After Love" "8/9/2017" "8/8/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/movies/after-love-review.html" 0 "The Belgian director Joachim Lafosse’s “After Love” is an irritating movie about irritating people. The married Boris and Marie are breaking up but for economic reasons are still sharing the same living space (to which the entire movie is confined; good thing there’s an outdoor patio). They have lovely twin daughters in front of whom they mostly argue — vehemently and with little regard for how these displays will affect the girls. Money is an issue; Marie comes from affluence, while Boris, a contractor who refers to himself as an architect, rarely has any. He incessantly confronts Marie over the labor he’s put into their apartment.
Marie, a narrowly conceived character nevertheless played well by Bérénice Bejo, is uptight and withholding; Boris, by turns warmly bearish and broadly truculent as played by Cédric Kahn, is controlling and manipulative, not to mention aggressively self-pitying. When he responds sympathetically to Marie’s vulnerability, it’s hard to tell if he is being sincere in his affection, or just exploiting a weakness. (Marthe Keller makes a welcome contribution as Marie’s mother, whose voice-of-experience advice to her daughter falls on willfully deaf ears.)
Not unlike an expensively tattooed panhandler, the couple elicit only a skeptical kind of sympathy. The American filmmaker John Cassavetes was able to make this kind of hate-love-hate scenario compulsively watchable (in movies like “A Woman Under the Influence”), partly because he made his characters operatically brash, their actions relentlessly emotionally combustible. “After Love,” written by Mazarine Pingeot, Fanny Burdino and Mr. Lafosse, and originally titled the less evocative but frankly more apt “L’économie du couple,” is too polite by half ever to generate any such sparks." 0.392472647 "Drama" "Unrated" "Distrib Films" "" "$8,576 " "$25,108 " "$8,886,990 " "96" "20-Nov-09" "4-Mar-10" "105" 15

At least that’s the case in “After the Storm,” a new film from the writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda. Tall and lean, Mr. Abe has handsome features — floppy dark hair across his forehead, prominent cheekbones and a long jaw line. But here, playing Ryota Shinoda, a onetime literary sensation fallen on hard times professionally and personally, he also has lines around and bags under his eyes, a perpetual five o’clock shadow and a downcast mouth. He looks as if he could be trouble.
As it happens, he is trouble mostly for himself, although he manages to irritate his ex-wife, Kyoko (Yoko Maki), because of his inability to pay child support for their son, Shingo (Taiyo Yoshizawa), and frustrate his sister (Satomi Kobayashi), whom he hits up for money with grim regularity. Ryota, having never followed up on his award-winning first novel, now works as a private detective. (The novel is another thing his sister is annoyed about; “Don’t you dare write about us again,” she snaps at one point.) It’s a gig that gives him many opportunities to alter the calibration of his moral compass — in one scene he tries to talk a subject of an investigation into buying the evidence he’s gathered against her. He also spies on his ex-wife, and is less than thrilled to learn that her unctuous new boyfriend has bought Shingo a snazzy baseball mitt.
Ryota’s aging mother, Yoshiko (Kirin Kiki), loves him unconditionally, though, and she doesn’t give him a hard time when she walks in after he’s clearly been rifling through her apartment, trying to find a family heirloom to pawn. She lives alone (the family’s patriarch has died, presumably recently) in a Tokyo apartment complex far removed from the bustling city we are accustomed to seeing in Japanese films, or films about Japan. The neighborhood isn’t showy, but it’s a pleasant, relatively tree-lined environment, and its older residents get together in informal groups to listen to and discuss Beethoven. Nevertheless, Yoshiko is a little preoccupied with what she sees as the approaching end of her life.
As Ryota scrambles to somehow get ahead, Kyoko seems befuddled by her own resentments and prospects for the future. Meanwhile, the young Shingo bristles at a potential stepfather who offers baseball coaching along the lines of “To be the hero, you have to get a hit” even though the situation under consideration calls for drawing a walk. At one point, Ryota, Yoshiko, Kyoko and Shingo all have to pull together during an overnight typhoon that strands them in Yoshiko’s apartment, which is cozy and conspicuously lacking in privacy.
Mr. Kore-eda, whose most noteworthy family dramas include “Still Walking” (2009) and “Like Father, Like Son” (2014), works in a quiet cinematic register, and the slightest error in tone could upend the whole enterprise. Slow-paced, sad, rueful and sometimes warmly funny, “After the Storm” is one of his sturdiest, and most sensitive, constructions. “I really just can’t understand how things turned out like this,” one character says while sitting out the storm.
As perplexed as they are about how they got into such a mess, the characters are nonetheless obliged to move forward as some kind of family, and the story patiently brings them closer to a reconciliation with that fact. Beautifully acted by a great cast (particularly Mr. Abe, who can make a sonata of frustration out of burrowing into a stale frozen treat with a spoon), “After the Storm” brings this intimate struggle to moving life.

The camera then reverses angles, and viewers see the white canvas suddenly turn vivid red. Indeed, the entire studio is soon suffused with red, because a giant banner celebrating Stalin is being hoisted up the front of the building. Strzeminski crawls over to his window — he lost an arm and a leg from injuries suffered in World War I — and pokes at the banner with one of his crutches, rending the fabric somewhat, which attracts the attention of the apparatchiks in charge of the operation. And so Strzeminski’s latest troubles begin.
A committed avant-garde painter who tells his students that art is about an individual way of seeing rather than about rote reproduction of a collectively agreed-upon reality, Strzeminski collides with the latest modes demanded by Stalinist rule. “Afterimage,” the final film directed by the Polish master Andrzej Wajda, who died in 2016 at 90, depicts an appalling system, filled with complicit go-along-to-get-along citizens, grinding down Strzeminski, a real-life figure.
“Have you really met Marc Chagall?” one of the bureaucrats asks Strzeminski shortly after she fires him from what will be his last paying job. The reaction shot is quietly devastating in the hands of the great Polish actor Boguslaw Linda, a Wajda veteran, who plays Strzeminski.
This is an angry, vivid, passionate film. Cinema is worse off now that Wajda, one of the truly towering greats of the form, is dead; there is some consolation, though, that he went out with his boots still most defiantly on." 0.801406714 "Biography" "Unrated" "Film Movement" "" "$2,075 " "$9,104 " "$5,500,000 " "37" "25-May-01" "" "" NA

But the remarkable tale it tells — of a family split up and dispersed to different continents, and the detective work required to figure out what had happened — turns this documentary into a fascinating mystery of reshuffled identities. In this time of mass displacement across the globe, it is a stark reminder of how traumatic the refugee experience often is.
At 3, Izak Szewelewicz was sent by his mother, Aida, to Israel from Bergen-Belsen to be raised by foster parents. “It was the best I could do,” she says simply when interviewed. Aida herself immigrated to Canada and would visit Izak on rare occasions. But she never told him that he had a younger brother, or that his father had taken the brother but that she didn’t know where. Izak learned of this when he was 67, in 2013. The Schwarzes, Izak’s nephews, assisted him while filming this unfolding account.
With the help of investigators and archives in Europe, Canada and Israel, Izak meets his brother, Shepsel, who is blind and living in Winnipeg. But the teary reunion and Shepsel’s first nervous meeting with Aida are just the start. As Izak and Shepsel try to assemble their family history, questions abound. Friends of Aida recount bits of background she had shared. At 89, though, Aida remains evasive: She doesn’t recall that man with her and the boys in that Bergen-Belsen photo; she’s fuzzy on why she moved to Canada without Shepsel and his father.

So much has changed in the world, and in movies, since the first “Alien” freaked out audiences in 1979, that the appearance of a chittering, scurrying, fast-spawning extraterrestrial predator feels like a visit from an old friend. Humanity may have lapsed into terminal tedium or hubristic stupidity, but that creature, with long, slender limbs and a cranium like a speedskater’s helmet, remains interesting.
The same can be said about “Alien: Covenant,” which follows  “Prometheus” in Ridley Scott’s 21st-century refurbishing of the franchise he initiated (with the crucial contributions of Sigourney Weaver and the graphic artist H. R. Giger) almost 40 years ago. It’s an interesting movie. I wish I could be more effusive, but “Covenant,” for all its interplanetary ranging, commits itself above all to the canny management of expectations.
To complain about its lack of ambition would be to misconstrue its intentions. Rather than setting out to conquer new worlds or excavate primal fears, this “Alien” is content to uphold a long-lived and well-regarded brand. Correcting some of the previous film’s mistakes — not enough alien! too much mythological mumbo-jumbo best left to movies with “Star” in the title! — Mr. Scott parcels out carefully measured portions of awe, wonder and terror on the established installment plan. This episode needs to satisfy you just enough to make sure you come back for the next one.
The story begins 10 years after the events of “Prometheus” and ends en route to a sequel that will bring us closer to the beginning of the cycle. (Arranging installments in sequential order is a totally old-fashioned, linear, 20th-century way of doing business.) As usual, a starship is plying the far reaches of space. As usual, the crew is a collection of talented actors obeying the imperatives of science-fiction seriousness. There are a bunch of married couples — James Franco and Katherine Waterston; Danny McBride and Amy Seimetz; Demián Bichir and Nathaniel Dean; Billy Crudup and Carmen Ejogo — and others with enough personality to make us feel a little something when they die.
Most of them do. Mr. Franco’s character, the captain of the Covenant, is a goner at the outset, reanimated in videos that stir his widow’s grief. The first mate (Mr. Crudup) assumes command and leads his subordinates onto the surface of the green but curiously lifeless planet, the exact spot where some of the Prometheus crew members ended up. There they meet a robot named David, who invites some of the astronauts back to his cave to look at his etchings.
David — seen in “Prometheus” and in a Kubrick-esque prologue here — is played by Michael Fassbender. So is another robot named Walter, a slightly updated model from the Weyland corporation. The differences between the two machines are striking. Walter wears his hair parted on the side and has been engineered to speak like someone from Wisconsin. (How does Mr. Fassbender do it?)
David, in contrast, has a crisp British accent and an acquaintance with human culture that extends to Wagner and Michelangelo but is a bit wobbly on romantic poetry. Viewers who stayed awake through freshman English or the fifth season of “Breaking Bad” know full well that Byron didn’t write “Ozymandias.” I’m telling you this so you aren’t fooled (as I confess I was) into spending a few minutes feeling smarter than the screenwriters, John Logan and Dante Harper. I don’t think that counts as a spoiler.
And Mr. Scott is, in any case, a nearly spoiler-proof filmmaker. Even his lesser efforts are infused with enough craft and energy to keep you engaged and surprised, and “Alien: Covenant” is no exception. The gloom and shadows of the inhospitable planet and the hushed, antiseptic corridors of the Covenant are superior horror-movie environments, and the fact that you know more or less exactly what’s coming doesn’t diminish the creepiness, or lessen the jolt when the thing you’re dreading arrives.
David, it turns out, has devoted the years since “Prometheus” to the study and cultivation of our beloved alien, while also harboring a grudge against the species that created him. Walter, in contrast, is more of a humanist, and the quarrel between them is not unlike the one between Magneto and Professor X in the “X-Men” movies (speaking of Michael Fassbender) or Koba and Caesar in “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” (speaking of posthumous James Franco). I will leave it to you to decide who has the better argument, and who deserves to prevail.
The answer, in any case, can only be the Giger alien itself, a contribution to the pantheon of modern design up there with the Coca-Cola logo and the Nike swoosh. From spore to embryo to full-grown raptor and all the stages in between, this monster is the stubborn movie equivalent of an earworm — a lovable parasite, a squiggle of pop-cultural DNA that burrows into your rib cage and never goes away." 0.980663995 "Horror" "R" "Fox" "$97,000,000 " "$36,160,621 " "$74,262,031 " "" "1,684" "25-Nov-87" "" "" NA

That missed opportunity resonates particularly at the movie’s end, when text lists an impressive number of statistics concerning his record sales and motion picture appearances. Viewers are also reminded that Shakur was only 25 when he died in September 1996 after being fatally injured in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas. His killing has never been solved.
From the opening, Mr. Boom’s direction is uniformly uninspired: A reporter’s prison interview with Shakur frames the movie’s first half, and Mr. Boom blocks and shoots his scenes with dismal stolidness. Few sequences last longer than a couple of minutes; the movie plods along with a “and then this happened” dutifulness, occasionally cutting back to the prison interview to have the reporter ask a pointed question or two. This almost invariably allows the film to excuse Shakur for bad actions that the reporter brings up during the interview. (Speaking of which, the movie is genuinely distasteful in its casual misogyny when depicting the sexual abuse case for which Shakur was convicted in 1994.)
Mr. Boom has genuinely good reason to chronicle Shakur’s eventful life even before his birth. Shakur’s mother, Afeni, who died last year, was a civil rights activist and a Black Panther; an early scene shows her emerging victorious from a conspiracy trial a month before giving birth to him.
But the intriguing, politically minded people he grew up among, as well as those he later made music and did business with, are portrayed in conventional, clichéd ways. “I’d rather die on my feet than live on my knees,” Shakur’s stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, proclaims at a meeting of a black community group.
“Your stepdaddy is a revolutionary,” Afeni, played by Danai Gurira, tells the young Tupac. “I’m gonna be a revolutionary,” he replies.
Almost all the dialogue is that flat-footed. (Jeremy Haft, Eddie Gonzalez and Steven Bagatourian wrote the script.) It’s a stark contrast to the almost always vivid power of Shakur’s own words, which could be profoundly empathetic and pettily profane. Not enough of them are heard here, but when Mr. Shipp has some of them at his disposal, or is given enough space in a scene to maneuver into an actual characterization, he is very impressive. This movie fails his considerable talents; I hope that he is soon afforded a better vehicle for them." 0.366068591 "Biography" "R" "Lionsgate/Summit" "$40,000,000 " "$26,435,354 " "$44,922,302 " "" "392" "9-Nov-90" "10-Jan-91" "" NA

Paul Getty would probably have disagreed with Shakespeare’s take. A hoarder of women, art, antiquities — and most of all, money — Getty also might have taken issue with Portia’s claim that mercy “becomes the throned monarch better than his crown.” Portia delivers her mercy speech as she tries to persuade Shylock not to take a pound of flesh. She would have had an even tougher time with Getty.
“All the Money in the World” is a story of towering greed and the absence of mercy, and an ideal 21st century morality tale. It’s about money and families and the ties that bind and cut, although because it was directed by Ridley Scott there isn’t a jot of sentimentalism gumming the works. In July 1973, John Paul Getty III (known as Paul), the elder Getty’s 16-year-old grandson, was snatched off a street in Rome. His kidnappers demanded $17 million in ransom, telling Paul’s mother, “Get it from London.” It was a reference to Getty Sr., who in turn responded, “If I pay one penny now, I’ll have 14 kidnapped grandchildren,” a kiss-off heard around the world.
Mr. Scott sets the scene quickly with a somewhat phantasmagoric meander through Rome’s crowded streets. It’s night, and pretty, boyish Paul (Charlie Plummer) is savoring la dolce vita, floating past the city’s flesh and marble beauties and its swarms of catcalling, hustling paparazzi. There’s sensuousness to Paul’s drift, which, as the camera silkily slips alongside him, suggests a casual luxurious attitude toward life, of being free to do anything, go anywhere, say anything. He’s kissed by fortune but also by youth. And when a streetwalker calls him baby and he smiles, you see just how young. Within seconds he’s been kidnapped.
“All the Money in the World” revs up beautifully, first as a thriller. But while the kidnapping is the movie’s main event, it is only part of a story that is, by turns, a sordid, desperate and anguished tragedy about money. When Paul is kidnapped, Getty Sr. (Christopher Plummer) has already amassed a fortune, one partly pumped out of oil fields both in the United States and in the Middle East. (The Plummers are not related.) He lives alone in crepuscular gloom in Sutton Place, a manor house built by a favorite courtier of Henry VIII. There, amid miles of rooms adorned with gilt-framed masterworks, Getty Sr. closely monitors the stock information on the disgorging ticker tape that’s both his leash and lifeline.
Mr. Scott is a virtuoso of obsession, of men and women possessed. He likes darkness, pictorially and of the soul, and in Getty Sr. he has a magnificent specimen. And in Mr. Plummer he has a great actor giving a performance with a singular asterisk: In early November, with the movie already done, Mr. Scott hired Mr. Plummer to replace Kevin Spacey, who has been accused of sexual misconduct. It was a bold move, an extreme variation on leaving a performance on the cutting-room floor. The 88-year-old Mr. Plummer isn’t fully persuasive when briefly playing the younger Getty Sr., even in long shot. But his performance is so dominating, so magnetic and monstrous that it doesn’t matter.
Like many contemporary movies, this one kinks up its timeline. After Paul is kidnapped, the scene shifts to Saudi Arabia in 1948, where Getty Sr. is laying the foundation for an even greater fortune. Written by David Scarpa — working from John Pearson’s 1995 book “Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortune and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty” — the movie continues to jump around, filling in the back story while deepening the atmosphere and gathering the dramatis personae. One intimate scene takes place in the 1960s, where Paul’s mother, Gail (Michelle Williams, warmth incarnate), and father, Getty Jr. (Andrew Buchan), are going broke with four boisterous young children.
By the time Paul is kidnapped, his nuclear family has imploded; Getty Jr. is lost in an opium cloud and Gail is living in Rome. Much of the movie involves the drama of the kidnapping, which unfolds in separate, increasingly tightly woven-together lines of action. Taken by a ragtag criminal gang, Paul is stashed in a desolate farmhouse, where his closest keeper becomes Cinquanta (Romain Duris, a charismatically feral presence). In Rome, Gail struggles with the kidnappers, police and paparazzi while trying to interest Getty Sr. in his grandson. Getty Sr. continues counting out his money, only reluctantly calling in the cavalry, a security specialist, Fletcher (a very fine Mark Wahlberg).
Mr. Scott conjures up entire worlds and sensibilities with visual precision, adding detail even when going for sweep. Each new scene adds another layer of meaning, thickening the slow-building sense of dread: the men in billowing white robes on oil-rich land waiting for Getty Sr., a master of the universe who arrives in a demonically belching train. Gail and Getty Jr., anxiously presenting their young family to Getty Sr. like paupers bowing down before the lord of the realm. As the story shifts from farmhouse to manor, from the kidnappers to Getty Sr. (each side armed, impatient, brutal), a parallelism develops and it becomes clear that he took his family hostage long before the kidnapping.
Mr. Plummer can be an aloof, fairly cool screen presence and he chills Getty Sr. with cruel glints, funereal insinuation and a controlled, withholding physicality. A lot of actors soften their heavies, as if nervously asserting their own humanity. With Mr. Scott, Mr. Plummer instead creates a rapacious man whose hunger for wealth and power (and more money, always more) has hollowed him out and whose fatherly touch, at its most consuming, brings to mind Goya’s painting of Saturn eating his son. The horror of Getty Sr. is that he is never less than human, but that he’s hoarded everything, including every last vestige of love, for himself. It’s a magnificent portrait of self-annihilation.
At one point in the movie, Getty Sr. does pull out his wallet, buying a masterpiece while Paul continues to languish with his kidnappers, an ordeal that grows more frightening and byzantine as the clock winds down. Gail and Fletcher are struggling to free Paul, an effort that finds them often grappling with Getty Sr. His interest in Paul rises and falls, much like the stock market does. He has become famous for his status as the wealthiest man in the world, prominence that he clings to, much like his money. He has filled his manor house with priceless objects, turning statues and paintings into fetishes. He has earned so much, spent so much and, in doing so, insured that he and everyone else have lost." 0.992951402 "Biography" "R" "TriStar" "" "$5,584,684 " "" "" "116" "22-Jan-16" "11-Feb-16" "21" 3

He has heard that if you tallied a lifetime’s experiences, you would get seven months of sex, 17 hours of breakups and 51 days of deciding what to wear.
“I wonder whose life they got the data from,” he asks in voice-over. Your own inclination to ask such questions, instead of surrendering, may be a litmus test for your enjoyment of Michal Marczak’s movie, a sometimes entrancing, sometimes tiresomely coy documentary-fiction hybrid that sketches Kris’s young adulthood in a blur of moony impressions.
The actors, if that’s the word, play characters who share their names. (There are moments, as when Kris smacks his head against a pole, when the film seems devoted to accidents.)
Mr. Marczak’s impressive, weightless-seeming camera work follows Kris and his roommate and friend Michal (Michal Huszcza) on an odyssey of romantic confusion. They flirt with women, attend parties until dawn and gyrate to a perpetual backbeat. Kris in particular can’t stop dancing, even — as the precious finale has it — in street traffic.
Favoring lyricism above substance, “All These Sleepless Nights” is almost a pure right-brain movie. What it omits may be as interesting as what’s onscreen. Older adults rarely appear, and money is apparently no object. (When Kris moves into his own apartment, we’re probably meant to enjoy the gorgeous skyline view instead of asking about the rent.)

Rapp, played by Dylan O’Brien (who has the bearing, manner and vocal inflections of a bantam Mark Wahlberg), is young, but not really a fresh face. We know his type pretty well. He possesses all the necessary skills but lacks the discipline that his employers supposedly demand. Conventional wisdom in his profession says that it’s never personal, but for a guy like Rapp it’s always personal. He may have a job to do, but he is also driven by longstanding grudges and unsettled scores. I’m not saying he’s a cliché, but at the end of the day, it is what it is.
The movie, directed by Michael Cuesta from a script by a team of blue-chip writers (Stephen Schiff and Michael Finch are credited, along with Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz), shows more skill than personality. There are fights and chases, punctuated by tense meetings and bouts of intense laptop and cellphone use. We hop from one camera-friendly hot spot to another before settling in Rome for the final round of fights and chases.
Since this is in effect an origin story, a certain amount of time needs to be spent on explaining how Rapp arrived at his vocation and showing how he was trained in it. The explaining is perfunctory: Terrorists killed his fiancée on a beach in Ibiza the day he proposed to her. The training is more elaborate, since it involves Michael Keaton.
Twenty-five years post-“Batman,” Mr. Keaton has re-emerged as the go-to wise, grizzled veteran of whatever you need him to be a wise, grizzled veteran of: car racing (“Need for Speed”); the newspaper business (“Spotlight”); Hollywood itself (“Birdman”). Here he plays Stan Hurley, who is putting together a top-secret black-ops program called Orion. Mitch, who had been planning a freelance revenge on his girl’s killer, has been recruited by the deputy C.I.A. director, Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan), who sees a perfect fit between the young hothead and the grizzled veteran.
She’s not wrong. There is some first-rate hardass mentoring from Hurley and some spirited defiance from Rapp against a backdrop of rogue Iranian nuclear shenanigans. There are also some perhaps not-fully-professional glances exchanged between Rapp and Annika (Shiva Negar), a colleague with a shadowy back story. In a Ludlumesque switcheroo, the geopolitical tensions are a bit of a red herring. The real enemy is a fellow known as Ghost (Taylor Kitsch), whose mentor Hurley used to be.
It is personal, then. It’s also decent fun, in the leathery, businesslike, self-satisfied manner of this kind of movie, which soothes the hurt places in the male ego with sentiment strategically disguised as toughness. So far there are 16 Mitch Rapp novels in print — the series, begun by Vince Flynn, has been kept going by Kyle Mills after Mr. Flynn’s death — and therefore plenty more of this kind of work to be done." 0.823880857 "Action" "R" "Lionsgate" "$33,000,000 " "$14,846,778 " "$36,249,674 " "" "1,208" "8-Feb-91" "" "" NA

Still, as the gliding camera keeps pace with this girl, a strange undercurrent disturbs the air, creating pinpricks of doubt about just how tranquil the scene is. There’s something about how red her top looks in the golden light, something about the quiet, something which suggests that the camera isn’t merely on the prowl but also out for blood. It’s a nice opening for a movie that spirals into nonsense.
Everything looks right in place in Anne Hamilton’s “American Fable,” all measured and ready to go. There’s Gitty (Peyton Kennedy), a wide-eyed 11-year-old girl, who lives with her farmer parents, Abe and Sarah (Kip Pardue and Marci Miller), and oddly hostile older brother, Martin (Gavin MacIntosh), on an isolated swath in the American heartland. It seems so peaceful or would if the wolf weren’t howling at Red Riding Hood’s door, bringing intimations of danger: angry talk, a slammed-down phone, a brandished ax and weird doings.
Gitty doesn’t grasp what’s going on with the family’s farm, but, like so much in “American Fable,” her naïveté comes off as forced, scripted rather than innate. Even so, her confusion starts to make sense given this story, which turns on her involvement in a ludicrous kidnapping scheme that’s neither persuasively real enough to believe nor fantastical enough to work for the fairy tale that Ms. Hamilton seems to be trying to create. The introduction of an outsider (Richard Schiff), a hapless moneyman who’s disparagingly likened to an animal by a villain, is especially unfortunate because it flirts with an anti-Semitic stereotype.
This stereotype isn’t exploited, developed or renounced. It’s just yet another loose end that flutters in “American Fable” alongside the predictably doomed pet chicken; the equally ill-fated neighbor; the nod to Ronald Reagan; the snippet from Yeats; the portentously injured fawn; and the sleek mystery woman (Zuleikha Robinson) whose woo-woo vibe and long gloves read like a nod to Jean Cocteau’s film “Orpheus.” Ms. Hamilton also appears to have a fondness for Charles Laughton’s “The Night of the Hunter,” which finds echoes here in the otherworldly starry night, a diabolical figure on horseback and a psycho with knife skills." 0.025130924 "Thriller" "Not Yet Rated" "IFC" "" "" "" "" "" "29-Jun-18" "" "" NA
"25" "American Made" "9/29/2017" "9/28/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/movies/american-made-review-tom-cruise.html" 0 "The tagline for “American Made,” a breezily, at times woozily rollicking Tom Cruise vehicle, announces that it is “based on a true lie” — though the movie also asserts that it is based on a true story. But who’s quibbling? This is, after all, a Hollywood fantasy starring Mr. Cruise as Barry Seal, a real-life smuggler. An enigma with multiple chins, Mr. Seal was apparently known as El Gordo (the Fat Man), a name he may have picked up while working for a drug cartel, the C.I.A. or the Drug Enforcement Administration.
It can be hard to keep tabs on the movie’s Barry, a pilot who racks up lots of miles while serving different masters. When the story opens, he is flying for T.W.A. and bored out of his evidently simple, rather dangerously restless mind. On the job, he amuses himself by flipping a few switches, jerking the controls and abruptly awakening sleeping passengers. His life takes a wild turn when a shady C.I.A. smiler, Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson), makes Barry an offer to help his country or something. Before long, Barry is cozying up to Pablo Escobar and smuggling cocaine and AK-47s across the Americas. Every so often, he drops into Panama to swap packages with that country’s strongman, Manuel Noriega.
This kind of secret world is familiar terrain for the director Doug Liman, who kick-started the “Bourne” spy franchise and directed “Fair Game,” a fictional take on some real-world intrigue involving Valerie Plame Wilson, a former C.I.A. officer, and her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, a onetime diplomat. “American Made,” in its self-amused tone and skittering rhythms, though, is closer to the thriller “Edge of Tomorrow,” Mr. Liman and Mr. Cruise’s movie about a man — a wrong-guy, wrong-place type — who dies to live another day only to die (repeat). Mr. Liman likes playing with Mr. Cruise’s persona, say, by messing up that famous smile, and he clearly likes letting his star strut and glide.
Mr. Liman also likes stories about people with secret selves. Maybe it’s an interest he picked up from his father, Arthur L. Liman, who was the chief counsel to the Senate committee during its 1987 Iran-contra investigation. The real Mr. Seal may have played a jaw-droppingly outlandish role in that notorious affair, which, among many other byzantine turns, involved the National Security Council funneling aid to the Nicaraguan contras. The scandal encompassed a vast cast of characters that included President Ronald Reagan and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. A few show up in “American Made” either as fictionalized supporting characters or as themselves, smiling and slinking in archival images.
Written by Gary Spinelli, “American Made” goes down easily, especially if you don’t let the historical record with its real-world stakes bother you. Mr. Cruise’s brisk, ingratiating performance — all smiles, hard-charging physicality and beads of sweat — does a lot to soften the edges. But Mr. Liman doesn’t press Mr. Cruise to dig into the character, and the actor mostly hurdles forward in a movie that never gets around to asking what makes Barry run and why. So Barry just runs and he flies and he flies some more, delivering coke and accumulating suitcases of cash that he buries and stashes in closets. (It’s hard not to think that Mr. Cruise signed on to the movie so he could do all his own flying.)
There’s a lot going for “American Made,” which spins like a top and has the visually beguiling, somewhat jaundiced look of a faded old Polaroid. So it’s too bad that Mr. Liman himself didn’t burrow in here as a filmmaker. The real Mr. Seal has been both the main and side attraction in many articles, books, documentaries and hard-core propaganda flicks, including some hinged on the Conspiratorial Industrial Complex which emerged during the Clinton presidency. Mr. Seal was also the subject of “Doublecrossed,” a 1991 HBO docudrama starring Dennis Hopper (which is vaguely amusing if only because Mr. Hopper played a very different coke smuggler in “Easy Rider”).
“American Made” encourages and earns your laughter, although it also provokes skepticism, particularly in its attempt to portray Barry as a picaresque hero, one of those rogues tumbling and swaggering from adventure to adventure in a world that’s more corrupt than they are. After all, it asks, how bad can Barry really be, especially given the company he keeps? He doesn’t kill anyone, not exactly, and he’s nice to his wife, Lucy (Sarah Wright Olsen), and their kids. A slightly downscale version of Margot Robbie’s character in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Lucy has a few tangy moments, but she and the kids mostly enhance the visual design, much like the period cars and costumes.
There are moments when it feels as if Mr. Liman’s breakneck pacing is partly an attempt to distract us, to keep us from looking or thinking too hard about the grotesquely corrupt circus parading onscreen. Mr. Cruise’s performance often seems similarly calculated. Barry likes to leap before he thinks: “All this is legal?” he asks, scarcely pausing before plunging into the fray — and Mr. Cruise regularly widens his eyes in what seems to be an effort to convey Barry’s incredulity. It’s dissembling that is about as convincing as the Wolf leering in granny’s nightie. In truth, this Barry is just another ugly American, a happy hustler with a what-me-worry smile and a foot planted on another man’s throat." 0.302862015 "Action" "R" "Universal" "$50,000,000 " "$16,776,390 " "$51,342,000 " "" "1,145" "9-Sep-88" "" "" NA

“An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,” a follow-up to “An Inconvenient Truth,” Davis Guggenheim’s Oscar-winning documentary from 2006, is a reboot that justifies its existence — and not just because Mr. Gore has fresh news to report on climate change since his previous multimedia presentation played in multiplexes.
Now gray-haired and at times sounding angrier in his speeches, Mr. Gore, in “Sequel,” takes on the air of a Shakespearean figure, a man long cast out of power by what he casually refers to as “the Supreme Court decision” (meaning Bush v. Gore) but still making the same arguments that have been hallmarks of his career.
If there is a thesis in this new documentary, directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk (“Audrie & Daisy”), it’s that a rise in extreme weather is making the impact of climate change harder to deny. The movie touches on Hurricane Sandy, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the wildfire in Fort McMurray, Canada, and the Zika virus. Mr. Gore visits Greenland and the flooded streets of the Miami area. (He acknowledges a complicated relationship with Florida.)
“The dots are seldom connected in the media,” he says at one point, but events like these are symptoms of global warming.
As positive developments, he notes the 2015 launch of the Deep Space Climate Observatory satellite, and visits a small city in Texas whose Republican mayor has decided that renewable energy makes market sense.
“An Inconvenient Sequel” delves deeper into the arcane details of compromise than its predecessor, with scenes of Mr. Gore working to find a middle ground between the needs of developed and developing nations. In a group meeting, Piyush Goyal, India’s power minister, pushes back against Mr. Gore’s desire to replicate in India the expanded use of solar energy in the United States. “I’ll do the same thing after 150 years,” Mr. Goyal replies.
During the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, Mr. Gore, who wasn’t an official negotiator, tries to persuade Lyndon Rive, then chief executive of the American company SolarCity, to grant India the rights to a patent on a type of solar technology. (The results aren’t clear from the film; India signed on to the Paris agreement without making a deal with SolarCity and still hasn’t made one.)
Mr. Gore likens President Trump’s election to a quip often attributed to Mike Tyson: You always have a plan until you get punched in the face. The movie has been updated since its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January to include Mr. Trump’s announcement of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, a decision that probably forecasts another sequel." 0.989844345 "Documentary" "PG" "Paramount" "$1,000,000 " "$124,823 " "$3,496,795 " "" "4" "31-Oct-08" "14-Dec-08" "49" 7

Should this trend continue, we could very well see one of Annabelle’s ancestors causing catastrophic delays in the building of the pyramids.
For now, though, we’re in the 1940s as a doll maker and his wife (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto) suffer the loss of their beloved daughter. A dozen years later, he’s a shuffling shell and she’s a disfigured recluse; so they open their rambling California farmhouse to a young nun and a clutch of orphaned girls. Wake up, Annabelle, your victims are here! Might I suggest you begin with the little one with the leg brace?
And so she does, terrorizing the youngsters in cheekily effective scenes while their host hovers ineffectually on the fringes and his wife cowers behind her bed curtains. Gary Dauberman’s script is lamentably light on mythological details (can the demon survive indefinitely outside the doll, or does it have a curfew?), but its vacuousness allows the director, David F. Sandberg, to string together jolts any way he pleases.
As with last year’s “Lights Out,” he proves a master of the flash-scare, a nifty choreographer of precipitous timing and striptease visuals. But he’s also adroit with more leisurely horrors, like the snap-crackle-pop of the murderous shade flexing for the kill, or the slow animation of a sacklike scarecrow into a toothy obscenity.

Rahim takes enormous pride in his work, which he has been doing for 30 years, and he, at least outwardly, exhibits no qualms about his profession. When their time comes, he boasts, the death-row prisoners feel no pain because they die instantly. Rahim assures one man before he’s hanged that he is being sent to “a better place.”
The tricky mentor-protégé relationship between Rahim and Aiman, who’s 28, is the heart of this moderately gripping film, directed by Boo Junfeng, that by its end tells you more than you want to know about this form of capital punishment. The two appear to bond early, as when Aiman guides Rahim to a store from which he can replenish his dwindling supply of rope. By then, we’ve learned that Aiman, a polite, handsome Malay, is the son of a killer executed by Rahim years earlier.
A former army officer who was involved in gang violence when he was younger but has since changed his ways, Aiman lives with his older sister Suhaila (Mastura Ahmad), with whom he has a tense relationship. The dour Suhaila, who raised her brother almost single-handedly, is about to leave Singapore to marry her Australian fiancé and is critical of her Aiman’s new job.
At first “Apprentice” seems to be a basic revenge film in which Aiman stalks the man who killed his father. But it becomes psychologically more complex as it reveals Rahim’s buried rage and guilt over his occupation and Aiman’s ambivalence when offered the chance to step into his new boss’s shoes. “Apprentice” largely skirts the issue of capital punishment while letting it be known that most of the other guards don’t want the job.

It already is one, in a manner of speaking, given that its strengths are lavishly violent, inventively choreographed fights that have been glued together by nonsense and Charlize Theron. The nonsense involves spies chasing secrets in Berlin just before the fall of the wall, which may suggest John le Carré but plays closer to a dumb and dumber take on Boris and Natasha. Mostly, the movie is an excuse to watch a beautiful, deviously clever female avatar as she is stripped naked, dolled up and repeatedly beaten down only to rise again.
This sort of spectacle — dress her up, dress her down, smack her around and wait for payback — isn’t new, even if moviemakers like to insist otherwise. What’s moderately different here is the sexed-up packaging of the violence in combination with Ms. Theron, who plays Lorraine Broughton, a spy in Her Majesty’s Secret Service with a blond bob and a fondness for lethal heels. Like James Bond, Lorraine shoots to kill while remaining fabulously dressed to kill. This means she gets slammed around a lot, and takes almost as much punishment as she metes out. She’s a punching bag, but she’s also a fantasist’s dream girl: the avenging goddess, destroyer of men.
Lorraine gets plenty of opportunities to mix it up in Berlin, where the story soon turns into spy versus spy with washes of lurid color, topsy-turvy camerawork, loads of crashing cars and wall-to-wall pounding tunes. The airborne cars pirouette prettily, bashing and smashing with all the technological expertise production money can buy; the symphony of body blows, gun pops and crunching metal sounds fine and convincing. The tunes (“99 Luftballons”) basically just goose the violence and beg for laughs, having been chosen to elicit knowing smiles of recognition. At one point, James McAvoy sidles into the story looking all cool or something and wearing a smirk he needs to employ more cautiously.
For her part, Ms. Theron looks hot and color coordinated, with black-and-white outfits that suit her character’s ambiguity. Lorraine smokes and drinks and likes cold baths, preferably filled with ice cubes that do wonders for bruises and nipples. When she isn’t moodily bathing or staring — into a mirror, the distance, what have you — she does a surprising amount of walking. She goes here, promenades there, strolling down halls and mean streets that the director David Leitch turns into fashion runways. She doesn’t slip into rooms, she cat-walks, making entrances as if looking for trouble or paparazzi; it’s no wonder someone says she isn’t well disguised. Ms. Theron really is ready to play Bond.
Written by Kurt Johnstad, “Atomic Blonde” is based on “The Coldest City,” a darkly shadowed, minimalist graphic novel written by Antony Johnston and illustrated by Sam Hart. As in the novel, the movie continually shifts between Berlin, where all the action happens, and an interrogation room in which Lorraine is being drilled by some intelligence types (John Goodman, Toby Jones). On the page, this bifurcation works, but on the screen it saps the story’s momentum, partly because there’s no violence in the room to distract from the genericism and puerility of the dialogue. At least in Berlin there are streets, beats and the sight of restlessly moving, twisting, slamming bodies.
As she does, Ms. Theron locks down your attention immediately, holding you with her beauty and quiet vigilance. (She lets you see that she knows you’re watching her.) Plenty of pretty people slide right off the screen. Ms. Theron, by contrast, holds you partly because she doesn’t seem eager to let you in, keeping you curious as she keeps you at bay with reserve and sphinxlike smiles. This distance adds to her mystery and it also makes the eruptions of violence more electric. As “Mad Max: Fury Road” confirmed, she’s a natural warrior, but it’s interesting here that each exertion and exhalation, each meaty, pulpy thump, also seems to be battering the fortifications that she has built around her.
Mr. Leitch was one of the directors on “John Wick,” a model of economic genre filmmaking, and he gives this movie’s action scenes the same pummeling, visceral quality. Lorraine punches and is punched, and her body is soon mapped by bruises and abrasions. It’s a lot of abuse for such puny returns, even if the fights are the best parts of “Atomic Blonde.” Mr. Leitch understands the expressivity of hand-to-hand fights and he frames them accordingly, pushing in when it counts and pulling back to show entire bodies in whirling motion. The closeness underscores the intimacy of battle while the distance underlines the performative aspect, allowing you to see both the choreography and the violent beauty moving forward and backward one bloody step at a time." 0.975085837 "Action" "R" "Focus Features" "$30,000,000 " "$18,286,420 " "$51,687,870 " "" "1,354" "22-Feb-08" "20-Mar-08" "28" 4
"30" "Baby Driver" "6/28/2017" "6/27/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/movies/baby-driver-review-edgar-wright-ansel-elgort.html" 1 "In “Baby Driver,” the director Edgar Wright is out to show you a most excellent time. He’s never been one of those filmmakers who expect you to be blinded by the bright sheen of his résumé, which includes comical genre rethinks like the zombie flick “Shaun of the Dead” and the cop caper “Hot Fuzz.” Mr. Wright works for your love, hard enough that you notice the whirring machinery if perhaps not the strain. He wants it easy and breezy, although mostly he wants it cool, whether the latest means to his end, Baby (Ansel Elgort), is smooth-moving like Gene Kelly or burning rubber like Steve McQueen.
A genre ride with a rebuilt engine and a sweet paint job, “Baby Driver” is all about movement and sometimes stillness and how a beautiful man looks (feels, seems, is) even better when he’s in glorious, syncopated, restless motion. The first time you see Baby — that’s his handle, which suits Mr. Elgort, with his angelic face and young man’s lissomeness — he’s in the driver’s seat, where he belongs. The car doesn’t look like much, just a cherry-red box with doors and a spoiler. Like us, Baby is waiting for the action to start, seemingly sealed off from the outside world with his dark sunglasses and earbuds.
This is how Baby rolls, with shifting gears, pumping feet and thumping tunes, and how Mr. Wright rolls here as well. There’s a story, sure, about Baby getting in and out of trouble while finding love and money. He doesn’t have much of an inner life, but he has skills, a heavy back story and a kindly foster father, Joe (CJ Jones, who helps give the movie its faint heartbeat), a deaf invalid with whom he signs. Baby also has tinnitus, which he quells with music; mostly, he has killer timing and gracefully elastic, reactive physicality that suggests Mr. Wright has put in time with the films of Jacques Tati.
That’s wonderful company to keep and to learn from, especially when you’re as cleverly attentive a student as Mr. Wright. Baby drives hard, fast, tight and seemingly oh so effortlessly, spinning wheels across pavement like a Russian Olympian on ice. In the eye-tickling opener — a wham, bam, we’ll-take-the-cash-ma’am heist — Baby peels out in that red box (a souped-up Subaru) and motors into one of those warped Road Runner chases that builds momentum with near escapes, not-even-close winking and the twangy throbbing of “Bellbottoms,” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, a group once unforgettably described by the critic Robert Christgau as “avant-travestying da blooze.”
“Baby Driver” isn’t avant-travestying; it’s a pop pastiche par excellence, crammed with cubistic action; glowering and golly-gee types (played by the seductive likes of Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm, Eiza González and Lily James); and an encyclopedia of cinematic allusions, all basted in wall-to-wall tuneage. At times, the whole thing spins like a tribute album, a collection of covers of varying quality: diner yaks à la Quentin Tarantino, Godardian splashes of color. When it works, the allusions give you a contact high, like when a friend turns you on to a favorite movie. At other times, Mr. Wright’s pleasure veers into the self-satisfied, and all that love feels smothering, near-bullying, like bro-cinephilia in extremis.
In the main, it’s easy to go with Mr. Wright’s flow, partly because he rarely steps off the gas. It’s just go go go with an occasional stop for coffee or an amusingly testy sit-down with Baby’s shadowy boss, Doc, one of those all-seeing, all-knowing criminal mystics whom Kevin Spacey gives ominous ooze and a daddy’s mad (maybe nuts) indoor voice. Doc has something on Baby, who’s been forced into a life of bad behavior and company. That Baby has had no choice but to drive along plays as knowingly implausible as it sounds. But heroic fatalism and unwilling villainy remain enduring cinematic tropes, including in gangster movies, even if it means holding convention over complexity.
There’s much to enjoy in “Baby Driver,” including the satisfactions of genuine cinematic craft and technique, qualities that moviegoers can no longer take for granted. The edits snap, the colors pop and the cinematography serves the performances and the story rather than embalming them in an emptily showy, self-regarding directorial conceit. The emotions are mostly rote and cold, but the car chases are hot — at once fluid, geometric and rhythmic, with a beat Baby carries with him out of the car whether he’s on the stroll or the run. (The director of photography is Bill Pope; the editors are Paul Machliss and Jonathan Amos; and the stunt coordinator is Darrin Prescott, leading an army.)
“Baby Driver” is so good that you want it to be better and go deeper, for it to put down its guns (or at least hold them differently) and transcend its clichés and cine-quotes so it can rocket out of the genre safe box into the cosmic beyond where craft and technique transform into art. That’s admittedly somewhat of a greedy complaint, particularly given how much Mr. Wright does right and that he clearly wants you levitating out of your seat. It’s difficult to carp about a director who wants to please the audience this much (instead of, say, the franchise suits). At the same time, you have to wonder where Mr. Wright might go if he cut loose from his influences and let a little feeling muss up his form." 0.981442663 "Action" "R" "TriStar" "$34,000,000 " "$20,553,320 " "$107,825,862 " "" "1,276" "13-Jan-84" "" "" NA

But marry, it seems, they must. Shashank Khaitan builds his romantic comedy “Badrinath Ki Dulhania” (“Badrinath’s Bride”) around a self-possessed heroine — Vaidehi (Alia Bhatt), whose dreams may be ill-defined but don’t necessarily include marriage.
Vaidehi is up against a lot: The first scenes of “Badrinath” remind us comically, but baldly, that baby boys are still considered assets while girls are liabilities. (Instead of the usual note that no animals were hurt during its filming, this movie starts with a disclaimer about the 1961 Dowry Prohibition Act.)
Badrinath (Varun Dhawan), the fellow who falls for Vaidehi — at a wedding, of course — comes from a well-to-do family in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, that practically screams patriarchy. (His mother and sister-in-law are mainly silent; his father is a scowling tyrant with a sadistic streak.) Badrinath may be a notch or two above Vaidehi socially, but as she points out to him, he’s not her equal: She’s smart and ambitious; he’s neither. He is, though, sweet and persistent. Reader, she agrees to marry him.
Complications ensue, including a second-act detour to Singapore, where Vaidehi is studying to become an air hostess. (This is the best career Mr. Khaitan could dream up for his heroine?) Badrinath turns up in Singapore, too, and it’s on this non-Indian ground that the movie hammers home its point: A real man is one who respects women, or in his case, learns to. (And, yes, it’s sad that the movie’s simple moral has currency in present-day America as well as in India.)
If “Badrinath” ends up being less about female empowerment than about schooling gents on a cardinal rule, its pop comes from Ms. Bhatt. Hindi cinema conventions and Mr. Khaitan’s script may constrict Vaidehi’s options, but Ms. Bhatt cannot be contained. Without ever falling into the clichés of spunky Bollywood heroine, she effortlessly embodies that admirable thing: a modern woman." 0.682091622 "Comedy" "Unrated" "FIP" "" "$862,008 " "$1,993,259 " "" "1" "12-Mar-99" "" "" NA

Both are frustrated artists. She’s a writer who drives for Uber; he’s a graphic designer who has taken on corporate work. They feel increasing pressure to have a baby from friends and from Ben’s mother, none of whom know about Anna’s miscarriage. Their lives are consumed with petty squabbles.
“What if we turned all our fights into songs?” Anna asks. And while the songs have adequate toe-tapping potential, they are primarily a storytelling device, a way of lending this couples-therapy comedy some distinction. (In addition to writing, directing and starring in the movie, Ms. Lister-Jones composed the music for the tunes, mostly with Kyle Forester, and wrote the lyrics.)
Both leads are excellent together, and the movie is good at showing how Anna and Ben push each other’s buttons. (Ms. Lister-Jones also has strong instincts for how to frame their spats visually.) At other times, “Band Aid” feels overly tidy. Will Anna and Ben fix the dripping kitchen faucet — metaphor! — that’s seen in the first shot?
Some of the bigger laughs come from the periphery (a friend has a daughter named Isis — after the Egyptian goddess, of course). But the movie fires wide of the mark with Dave (Fred Armisen), the recovering sex addict and cocoa-fiend neighbor who becomes Anna and Ben’s drummer.

That’s one of the durable truisms of “Battle of the Sexes,” a glib, enjoyable fictionalization of the 1973 exhibition tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. She was 29 and one of the top female tennis players in the world. He was 55 and had been a world champion before she was born. She was a feminist symbol and the first female athlete to win more than $100,000 in a single year; he was a self-avowed male chauvinist pig who liked to gamble big. It was a man vs. woman match made for maximum public-relations gimmickry but also a deadly serious referendum on equality on and off the court.
So it was personal and it was political, which “Battle of the Sexes” gets. It was also entertainment, which is where the movie really excels. Nice and easy, it sets the players and early 1970s scene, with Billie Jean (Emma Stone) already making history and Bobby (Steve Carell) largely sidelined. She’s making waves as a player and as a champion of women’s rights, including equal pay, and earning plaudits from the likes of President Nixon. Bobby seems to be living off his indulgent wealthy wife (Elisabeth Shue), a frozen smiler right out of Stepford, and spending time on idle in a fancy office. Mostly, Billie Jean is winning while Bobby is keeping boredom at bay.
The directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton make these early scenes pop, cramming characters and information into Billie Jean and Bobby’s separate realities. Billie Jean’s is livelier, more engaging, partly because there’s more at stake and because she’s surrounded by chummy, pleasurably prickly women like Rosie Casals (Natalie Morales) and Gladys Heldman (a tangy Sarah Silverman), the founder of Tennis World magazine. Together with seven other top female players, these three form a feminist revolt called the Virginia Slims tour, a women’s pro circuit that sets out to combat the gross inequalities that defined professional (open) tennis since its advent in 1968.
As the sunny, sporty feminists stake their rightful claim — holding press conferences, drumming up support, winning and winning some more — a rather dark, clubbier male world comes into view. A gambler, Bobby watches Billie Jean on TV but hangs with masters of the universe, male cigar chompers and scotch swirlers who think nothing of betting away a Rolls-Royce. It looks like a lethal bore, as does Bobby’s home, where he plays with his young son under a conspicuously large and looming portrait of his wife. By the time Bobby is challenging Billie Jean to play it almost seems as if he were willing himself into the arms — or at least company — of this other woman.
It takes a while for them to meet on the court, partly because Billie Jean initially turns Bobby down. So instead, he takes on Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee), the Australian champion who becomes the movie’s female heavy. (The real Ms. Court has played that role off screen for her views on same-sex marriage and homosexuality, which she’s branded “a lust for the flesh.”) In a well-publicized faceoff soon called the Mother’s Day Massacre, Bobby defeats Margaret, a loss that Billie Jean feels she needs to correct. It’s game on, though with complications, including Billie Jean’s revelatory attraction to another woman, a hairdresser, Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough).
Ms. Faris and Mr. Dayton handle the many moving parts in Simon Beaufoy’s busy script smoothly as they toggle between intimate moments and public events, and set Billie Jean’s bedroom sighs off against Bobby’s heat-seeking braggadocio. There’s a lot to follow and a great deal to look at, including an atmospherically embellished past that turns the movie into a veritable wayback machine of amusing and amusingly unfortunate colors and choices. (The director of photography is Linus Sandgren; the production designer is Judy Becker.) There are plaid jackets and flirty minis, sideburns and shags, harvest-gold drapes and rooms perilously fogged in by cigarette smoke.
A revolution can be tough to squeeze into two hours, but “Battle of the Sexes” manages it mostly by skipping along its handsome surfaces. The film repeatedly announces that there’s a lot at stake here, but without much urgency or sting. Bobby’s sexist pronouncements are outrageous, but his stunts are so absurd and self-serving that they’re hard to take seriously. And while Mr. Carell bounces and sags persuasively, the characterization is finally so soft that Bobby comes off as more needy and pathetic than threatening. The better foil and villain is a tennis promoter, Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman), one of those men who never bothers to hide his contempt for women.
Billie Jean faces down Kramer at one point, speaking feminist truth to power: “It’s when we want a little bit of what you’ve got,” she says, “that’s what you can’t stand.” It’s a solid gotcha moment, but the reason it works as well as it does is its low-key realism, which underscores the absolute ordinariness of the sexism she’s calling out. Ms. Stone handles the scene exactly right, letting you see the tremor of indignation while keeping righteousness in view yet also in check. She’s unsurprisingly good and often moving, although the best thing about the performance is that Ms. Stone hasn’t been asked to play the girl who seduces us with big eyes and a smile.

"34" "Baywatch" "5/25/2017" "5/24/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/movies/baywatch-review-zac-efron-dwayne-johnson.html" 0 "In case the question should ever arise on a standardized test, the opposite of “prestige TV” is “Baywatch.” The series, which ran on NBC and in ubiquitous syndication through the 1990s, bequeathed a rich legacy of wet-suit fashion, Jet Ski safety and sunscreen awareness. In other news, Paramount has just released a movie called “Baywatch,” starring Dwayne Johnson in the role of the beach daddy originated by David Hasselhoff.
The film, directed by Seth Gordon (“Identity Thief,” “Horrible Bosses”), can be viewed from several perspectives, most notably the abdominal, the pectoral and the gluteal. If torsos and tails are not your thing, other aspects of human anatomy are also available for study. Arms and legs, for example. But though acres of flesh are exposed to view — most of it pleasingly sculpted — there is very little outright nudity and no sex to speak of.
You will, however, witness some rude and suggestive sight gags and an extended sequence in a morgue involving the genitals of a dead man. Those bits, and the energetic profanity in the script (written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift), represent cosmetic alterations intended to secure an R rating, at the moment a mark of credibility in the world of big-screen comedy. Make no mistake, though: The project’s essential network prime-time DNA remains intact. Like its source material, “Baywatch” is sleazy and wholesome, silly and earnest, dumb as a box of sand and slyly self-aware. It’s soft-serve ice cream. Crinkle-cut fries. A hot car and a skin rash. Tacky and phony and nasty and also kind of fun.
Not everything is surf and sand and eye candy, though. A movie requires a plot or five, and “Baywatch” barrels through enough action and story to fill a couple of hours. Mitch Buchannon (Mr. Johnson) is the guru and patriarch of a squad of lifeguards — a “family,” as every franchise team in this fast and furious age must be called. The other principal members are C. J. (Kelly Rohrbach) and Stephanie (Ilfenesh Hadera). They must supervise three trainees: Summer (Alexandra Daddario), Ronnie (Jon Bass) and Matt (Zac Efron, looking uncannily like a young, ripped and shrunken Mr. Hasselhoff).
Matt is a gold-medal-winning Olympic swimmer in disgrace, a bad boy in need of reforming. Ronnie is a pudgy nerd, with tech-geek skills and a brain-melting crush on C. J. Summer is there for Matt to ogle and flirt with, and to attest to the screenwriters’ utter inability to make a woman in a bathing suit an interesting character. Mr. Efron and Mr. Johnson are permitted to be funny and look sexy in their swimwear. The women mostly run to the rescue in their zippered one-pieces.
A partial exception is Priyanka Chopra, who appears not in a bathing suit but in a succession of slinky dresses that signify — along with her purring diction, her muscle-headed minions and her collection of champagne flutes and martini glasses — her character’s supervillain status. That character, Victoria Leeds, is a drug dealer and would-be real estate mogul whose machinations threaten the Bay. And the only people with the integrity, gumption and sleuthing skills to save it are Mitch and his lifeguards. The Bay is their life, after all.
For anyone contemplating the purchase of a ticket, the stakes are quite a bit lower. “Baywatch,” which, incidentally, features Mr. Johnson’s most credible acting since “The Tooth Fairy,” slots neatly into a subgenre that is perhaps too sloppy to have a name. But if you enjoy the “21 Jump Street” or “Ride Along” franchises, you won’t have too bad a time. The soundtrack hums with well-chosen, not-too-obvious hip-hop, R&B and rock classics; the humor is knowing and naughty without risking serious offense; and an inclusive brand of meta-ness is practiced. You don’t need to be privy to any particular “Baywatch” lore to get the jokes, and you’ll see a few nimble comic performers (Hannibal Buress, Yahya Abdul-Matteen II) in too-small roles.
You shouldn’t expect much in the way of cinema. The digital effects — fire and water, mostly — are lackluster, and the whole thing has a crummy, overcast, second-rate-theme-park look to it.

When not cruising the web with a cap on and shadows hiding his face, Frankie hangs out with macho, aimless potheads in and around the Coney Island boardwalk. (Like Ms. Hittman’s first feature, “It Felt Like Love,” “Beach Rats” doubles as a portrait of Brooklyn’s southern-shore neighborhoods, lyrically photographed by Hélène Louvart.)
During a fireworks show, Frankie effortlessly — in the sense of exerting no effort — catches the eye of Simone (Madeline Weinstein), who flirts with him oblivious to his uncertain sexuality. After initially taking her home only to rebuff her, he spends much of the movie waffling on the relationship, trying to make it work and even defensively confessing to a man he accompanies to a motel for sex that he has a girlfriend.
Frankie’s drug intake, his ailing father, his relationships with his mother (Kate Hodge) and younger sister (Nicole Flyus) and perhaps even his reluctance to leave familiar surroundings all contribute to a powerful sense of limbo. The back-and-forths of the character’s decisions feel real, and Mr. Dickinson’s laconic blankness (you would never guess the actor was British) helps to give Frankie’s existential crisis a charge.

It’s “Beauty and the Beast,” for goodness’ sake: a tale as old as time, a song as old as rhyme and all that. And there are inspired flights of nostalgia as well, visual evocations of the predigital glory of Busby Berkeley, Ray Harryhausen and other masters of fantastical craft.
But this live-action/digital hybrid, directed by Bill Condon and starring Emma Watson and Dan Stevens in the title roles, is more than a flesh-and-blood (and prosthetic fur-and-horns) revival of the 26-year-old cartoon, and more than a dutiful trip back to the pop-culture fairy-tale well. Its classicism feels unforced and fresh. Its romance neither winks nor panders. It looks good, moves gracefully and leaves a clean and invigorating aftertaste. I almost didn’t recognize the flavor: I think the name for it is joy.
This was by no means a foregone conclusion. The reanimation of beloved properties — to use the grim business nomenclature of Hollywood — often leads to hack work and zombie-ism, as old archetypes are shocked to life and arrayed in garish, synthetic modern effects. That might easily have happened here. Look (I mean: don’t look) at the horrors that have been visited, in recent years, on Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz. And even if Disney had done a more convincing upgrade, on the model of last year’s “Jungle Book,” a new “Beauty” could have offended fans of the 1991 animated feature simply by existing. That movie, a high point of the ’80s and ’90s Disney revival, is close to perfect. What singing teapot would dare to challenge Angela Lansbury?
The only possible answer is Emma Thompson, whose Mrs. Potts is joined by other household objects with the voices (and, briefly, the faces) of movie stars. Stanley Tucci and Audra McDonald are the excitable harpsichord and the operatic wardrobe; Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen are the suave candelabra and the anxious clock. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is the lissome feather duster. Young Nathan Mack is Chip, Mrs. Potts’s son. Their singing and banter is so vivid and so natural that you almost take for granted that they appear to be mechanical objects clicking and whirling in physical space, sharing the frame with human characters.
There are a few moments — a climactic high-elevation fight scene that looks like every other climactic high-elevation fight scene; a chase through the forest involving wolves — where the digital seams show, and you’re aware of the cold presence of lines of code behind the images. Most of the time, though, you are happily fooled. More than that: enchanted. The most dazzling visual flights are matched to the best of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken’s songs. “Be Our Guest” in particular is a choreographic extravaganza that enfolds decades of Disney history (all the way back to “Snow White” and “Fantasia”) in contemporary cinematic craft.
But the tradition of Disney features, both live action and animated, rigorously places spectacle in the service of plot. The audience needs to be, by turns, reassured and surprised, guided through startling and suspenseful events toward a never-in-doubt conclusion. The new “Beauty and the Beast,” written by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos, smoothly modernizes — and to some degree sanitizes — a story with a potentially thorny psychosexual subtext, a tale of male animality and female captivity. He’s a beast and a prince. She’s his prisoner and his therapist. It’s a little kinky if you stop to think about it, and also (to use a more responsible word) a little problematic.
Variations on the beauty-beast theme are hardly scarce. What else is “Twilight” (the last two movie installments were directed by Mr. Condon)? Or “Fifty Shades of Grey”? “Beauty and the Beast” decisively removes itself from such company by insisting on the heroism and competence of its heroine, Belle, a bookish and ingenious young woman who lives with her father (Kevin Kline) in a picture-book French village.
Ms. Watson, already something of a feminist pioneer thanks to her portrayal of Hermione Granger in the “Harry Potter” movies, perfectly embodies Belle’s compassion and intelligence. Mr. Stevens, blandly handsome as a human prince, is a splendid monster, especially when the diffidence and charm start to peek through the rage. The awkward business about imprisonment turning into true love is handled smoothly. If you want a hot and haunting “Beauty and the Beast,” check out Jean Cocteau’s version, or the fan-fiction-inspiring television show from the 1980s. This one is chaste and charming.
It’s Disney! Which means there will also be a villain and a comical sidekick, who steal many scenes on the way to their comeuppance. That would be Gaston (Luke Evans), a narcissistic cabbage-stomping former soldier and his adoring pal LeFou (Josh Gad). Gaston is sweet on Belle, and his excitement at her unambiguous refusals makes him the film’s avatar of nastiness. No redemption here. He goes from annoying to evil when he stirs up the anti-intellectualism and xenophobia of a populist mob to serve his own egomaniacal ends. The residents of the castle fight back because their humanity is at stake.

This is no spoiler: Samantha perishes in what has to be among the most heavily foreshadowed car accidents in recent movies, on a misty road in the dead of night. But then she wakes in a cycle of repetition reminiscent of “Groundhog Day,” living through the same sequence of events again and again until she gets it right.
The film, directed by Ry Russo-Young, written by Maria Maggenti and based on Lauren Oliver’s young-adult novel, isn’t a comedy but rather a dutiful entry in the intermittently popular dying-girl melodrama genre. The damp, forested Pacific Northwest setting puts us in the “Twilight” zone. The mood of morbid, smiling-through-tears sentimentality recalls “The Fault in Our Stars,” “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” and “If I Stay.”
The filmmakers take the sting out of death in two ways: by dissolving tragedy in a dubious, not-quite-religious metaphysical scheme and by making the principal characters so generic that they barely exist in the first place. Ms. Deutch is an alert and engaging performer, but Samantha is almost entirely devoid of interests, tastes or ideas.
The people around her are a little more distinctive, but only because they have entirely conventional roles to fulfill, more like video game avatars than flesh-and-blood beings. Samantha has a mom and a dad and an annoying younger sister, a jerky boyfriend she’s planning on sleeping with for the first time, another boy who is not-so-secretly in love with her, and a squad of friends. They can be sorted into the wild one, the responsible one and the Queen Bee — identities that are signaled, day after day, by obvious behavioral cues. There is also a weird girl who is tormented by Samantha and her crew, and whose fate turns out to be the axis on which the movie’s world turns.
“Before I Fall” is tactful rather than maudlin, tasteful rather than lurid, soothing rather than creepy. None of that is good news. Ms. Russo-Young’s earlier films (including “You Won’t Miss Me” and “Nobody Walks,” which she wrote with Lena Dunham) can be intriguingly oblique, using the natural diffidence of millennial characters to suggest hidden reservoirs of frustration, hostility, sorrow and desire. There is no such subtext here, no rough patches or sharp edges of individuality, and therefore nothing to care or wonder about. The twists are smoothed out, the dots are connected and the day finally ends, almost as if it had never happened at all." 0.154273145 "Drama" "PG-13" "Open Road Films" "" "$4,690,214 " "$12,241,122 " "" "273" "6-May-17" "6-May-17" "2" 0.3

By dint of compassion, cussedness and innovation — like training ordinary villagers to act as community health visitors — the two would go on to build clinics and create programs that could be imitated worldwide.
Gathering collaborators along the way — including a wealthy philanthropist and their group’s president, Ophelia Dahl (the daughter of the author Roald Dahl) — the men refused to be deterred by institutional rigidity, political apathy or a skeptical scientific community. Their perseverance is cheering, giving the movie a brightly buoyant tone that belies the suffering at its center and renders the sometimes distracting musical score largely unnecessary.
Assisted by archival film originally shot for earlier projects, the directors, Kief Davidson and Pedro Kos, build a 30-year-plus dramatic timeline that focuses most intently on Dr. Farmer (who was also profiled in Tracy Kidder’s 2003 book, “Mountains Beyond Mountains”). His quiet outrage over the widely-held assumption that it’s futile to treat the global poor drives this story, which is finally as much about the triumph of a philosophy as of medicine.
Dr. Kim agrees. “Optimism is a moral choice,” he says, one that undergirds programs grounded in extreme practicality. You don’t have to be an altruist to accept that pandemics are best averted in the countries where they typically begin." 0.82649972 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Abramorama" "" "$3,276 " "$112,036 " "$24,395,933 " "3,121" "16-Sep-16" "27-Oct-16" "42" 6

Playing Clare, an Australian photographer looking for inspiration and adventure in Berlin, she seems to aspire to walk on air as she emerges from a subway station; a little later, leaning over the railing of the roof of the youth hostel where she’s staying, she looks similarly ready to take off.
But soon this aspirant bird will be caged. A meet-cute with an intellectual schoolteacher named Andi (Max Riemelt) leads to flirtation, an intense sexual assignation and an unsettling discovery the morning after. She can’t leave his apartment. It soon becomes horrifically apparent that the not-leaving component is part of a larger scheme that Andi has enacted before.
I can’t speak from personal experience, but it seems the stages of captivity aren’t too different from the stages of grief. Once disbelief subsides, Clare starts to rage, but Andi’s living quarters are diabolically designed to contain her and her anger.
The movie is based on a 2011 novel of the same name by Melanie Joosten, but viewers of a certain age will detect an affinity with “The Collector,” the 1965 picture by William Wyler, based on a John Fowles novel. The director, Cate Shortland, making her third feature, depicts both the degradations endured by Clare and the peculiar psychological ins and outs of the captor-captive dynamic in explicit, sometimes excruciating detail. Her insistent imagery and sometimes oblique narrative approach don’t always deliver the dividends sought. But the movie identifies Ms. Shortland as a talent to watch. And it should constitute some kind of breakthrough for Ms. Palmer, who has not been given much of interest to do since she arrived in Hollywood a little over a decade ago." 0.722996299 "Thriller" "R" "Vertical Entertainment" "" "$22,916 " "$28,660 " "" "4" "2-Nov-12" "" "3" 0.4

A stalled truck forces the two to take the subway, at which time their city is subject to a very gnarly alien attack.
The prospect of a hybrid of “Battle: Los Angeles” (2011) and Andrzev Wajda’s “Kanal” (1956) is not necessarily displeasing, but as it happens, “Beyond Skyline,” written and directed by Liam O’Donnell, is much, much more. (Among other things, it’s a kind of sequel to the 2010 film “Skyline,” for which Mr. O’Donnell was one of the two screenwriters, retaining its aliens but jettisoning its characters.)
Fleeing the invaders via subway tunnels doesn’t work, so soon Mark, Trent and a few stock types are in an alien ship, besieged by fearsome creatures with tentacles that unscrew the tops of human heads. One of the captives is a blind Vietnam vet, which is interesting, because eventually the alien ship crashes in Laos, right on the Mekong River, where Mark must protect the newborn he delivered on the ship. (Long story.) The movie, which lists several Asian companies as co-producers, then morphs into a sci-fi martial arts picture, featuring a scene in which a woman lures a giant alien beast into a minefield.
Whether you find this as much fun to watch as it is to describe will depend on your tolerance for clichés in dialogue (“I’m so sorry your family is gone. But killing yourself … is not gonna change that”), music (lots of string sections syncopating in high register) and much else. Also in how credible you find Mr. Grillo as an action star.

There is a pig who sails a boat, a team of father-and-son garbage-scavenging rats, a little fox named Little Fox and a dog who is training to be a police officer.
But this is not a cute movie, and while it will intrigue many 10- and 11-year-olds, younger children are likely to be more than a little freaked out. Its enchantments are dark, its ideas somber and brutal. Adapted by Pedro Rivero and Alberto Vázquez from Mr. Vázquez’s graphic novel, the film, originally called “Psiconautas” (“Psychonauts”), conjures a bleak vision of a post- or perhaps mid-apocalyptic landscape of predation, addiction and demonic possession. So maybe it’s actually the perfect children’s entertainment for 2017.
Birdboy is a creature with an enormous round head and a tiny beak who dresses in a black suit, white shirt and skinny tie, like a member of the “Reservoir Dogs” cast or of an ’80s ska revival band. The lighthouse he once called home is infested by demonic birds, so he flaps around looking for drugs and trying not to get shot.
The island where he and the other animals live has been blighted by a nuclear accident. The trees are bare, and the population is divided between a countryside of tidy houses, forests and open fields, and an industrial zone heaped with refuse and ruled by the law of the jungle. Life is pretty awful for everyone. Dinky, who is more or less the heroine of the story (and turns out to be Birdboy’s former girlfriend), quietly seethes in the company of her grotesque mother and stepfather. Her schoolmate Sandra is tormented by voices in her head. Their friend Little Fox is bullied.
A lot of incident is packed into a 76-minute running time, giving “Birdboy” the scale of a miniature epic. It’s a little too much, and especially toward the end, the delicate originality of the imagery gives way to familiar movie tropes. (The final moments jarringly evoke “Avatar,” of all things.) But the simple precision of the hand-drawn characters and of the watercolor world they inhabit provide visual coherence and establish an atmosphere of fascination as well as dread. The movie is an anthology of nightmares compressed into a picture book." 0.926231945 "Animation" "Unrated" "GKIDS" "" "$5,094 " "$21,515 " "$2,164,677 " "1" "19-Oct-07" "3-Jan-08" "56" 8

The screenwriters Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson and the director George Nolfi only intermittently manage to breathe credible cinematic life into that milieu in “Birth of the Dragon,” which is set in late ’60s San Francisco, where, the movie tells us, Lee taught kung fu. (It was actually Oakland.)
The movie’s linchpin is a real-life battle between Lee (Philip Ng) and a Shaolin monk, Wong Jack Man (Yu Xia), which an opening title says was reputed to have been spurred by Wong’s objection to Lee’s “kung fu for all” ethos. In the movie’s view, Lee’s real problem is his bluff arrogance. Wong’s approach is more spiritual, less egocentric. This attracts one of Lee’s white students, the overly aggressive Steve (Billy Magnussen), who happens to be in love with a young Asian immigrant who’s being groomed for a concubine’s life by a female boss. Steve can’t fight for her, but the boss is interested in staging an event that can generate some gambling profits. You see where this is going. For the sake of their pal, Wong and Lee agree to test each other in battle. It’s clear that Wong is right about Lee’s egotism being a limitation, but the question is whether Lee will get it.
The “West Side Story” romance angle is the least interesting part of the movie, so it’s frustrating that so much time is spent on it. “Birth of the Dragon” is ambitious: It wants to be a character study, an explication of martial arts philosophy and an action picture. (The battle scenes are presented in a mix of slow motion with super-clear fast-shutter shots and they’re not always enhanced by this approach.) But the film never really gets fully juiced until the climax, when rivalries are put aside and the two very charismatic leads get on the same side to kick some righteous butt." 0.078261281 "Action" "PG-13" "BH Tilt" "" "$2,702,430 " "$6,901,965 " "" "31" "20-Feb-04" "29-Feb-04" "10" 1.4

Abortion is beside the point. The thesis here is that, after Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, opponents of the decision spent the next 40 years organizing an incremental offensive on multiple fronts to restrict access to abortion, contraception and sterilization by piling on state regulations and putting forward political candidates to further their cause.
The anti-abortion talking heads in the film do not deny the strategy, nor do they get much of the spotlight. This documentary, directed by Civia Tamarkin and written by Ms. Tamarkin and Luchina Fisher, argues that new laws have stripped away health services unrelated to abortion and have deprived women, particularly those with lower incomes, of routine care. While women’s clinics and providers were attacked by violent extremists and closed as funding dried up, more insidious, less publicized changes, including the legislation and the mergers and acquisitions that brought hospitals under the control of religious groups, were having far-reaching effects.
The case histories are stacked to support the film’s point of view, but that doesn’t make them less painful. Worst are the new mothers jailed on child-abuse charges because of drug tests administered without their knowledge. The victims are the babies, left motherless. One woman had to wait out a nonviable pregnancy because the law forbade inducing labor after 20 weeks. A single mother with several children was denied sterilization surgery because of a hospital’s religious beliefs; Medicaid limited her providers, and she could not afford to travel to a distant clinic.

The topic is worthy, but the execution is painfully heavy-handed. Keening choirs and cadaverous extras bear witness as Yuri (Max Irons) leaves the family farm and his childhood sweetheart, Natalka (Samantha Barks), to attend art school in Kiev. While Joseph Stalin seizes Ukrainian land and grain, and Yuri entangles himself in the anti-Bolshevik resistance, Natalka fends off the creepy attentions of the village’s Soviet overlord (Tamer Hassan). Can she get close enough to kill him before she’s forced to eat his vile-looking borscht?
Directed by George Mendeluk and filmed, very prettily, in Ukraine by the British cinematographer Douglas Milsome (whose dusty landscapes were a highlight of the 1989 television mini-series “Lonesome Dove”), “Bitter Harvest” feels awkward and parochial. Unlike Natalka, the movie has no backbone, flopping from scene to scene without any sense of scope or spectacle.
Mr. Mendeluk has Ukrainian roots, but he also has an unfortunate taste for clunky symbolism, zooming in his camera on ominously crushed eyeglasses and a blood-flecked loaf of bread like a spaniel scenting pheasant. His emotional investment in the material is clear, but the millions who died during this real-life tragedy deserve a stronger memorial than this one." 0.087660359 "Drama" "R" "Roadside Attractions" "" "$219,357 " "$557,241 " "" "1" "29-Jan-10" "8-Jul-10" "98" 14

Imagine, then, how much tougher to dispatch is a samurai whose wounds — the physical ones, anyway — heal themselves, and you have a fair idea of the sheer volume of damage visited on Manji (Takuya Kimura), the justifiably grumpy centerpiece of Takashi Miike’s “Blade of the Immortal.”
Adding a soupçon of sorcery to the genre’s typical vengeance saga, Manji’s immortality effectively embellishes the slice-and-dice dust-ups that propel the plot and punctuate Tetsuya Oishi’s screenplay. (As it happens, Manji can be rubbed out, just exceedingly slowly — like, over years.) Based on the eponymous long-running manga series by Hiroaki Samura, the story opens on a stunning black-and-white battle that leaves Manji mortally wounded and his little sister slain.
Out of nowhere, an ancient crone appears and stuffs sacred worms into his wounds. Like slimy paramedics, the creatures rejoin his gashes and gloppily reattach his severed hand, but Manji feels more cursed than blessed. And when the movie leaps 50 years ahead and bursts into color we find him scarred, reclusive and not at all eager to help a young girl named Rin (Hana Sugisaki) avenge the murder of her parents. But Rin looks exactly like his sister, and a “True Grit” connection develops that will send them on one of the bloodiest quests in samurai history.
It’s also one of the most bonkers. Single-handedly facing down a succession of riverine hordes, Manji also has to dodge ultra-colorful weaponry — like blades cunningly designed to relocate your insides to your outsides — and an array of fancifully coifed and costumed lone opponents. These include a lithe young swordswoman, bravely defying the constraints of a purple maxi skirt and platform sandals; a masked monster with dead heads strapped to his shoulders; a fellow immortal who’s 200 years old and ready to die after seeing five wives to their graves. (A conservative number, I thought, for two centuries.)
Though not nearly as mindful or meaty as Mr. Miike’s 2011 triumph, “13 Assassins,” “Blade” is creatively gory fun. Overlong and over-the-top, the brutality finally becomes repetitive and somewhat deadening; but Mr. Miike has learned a few tricks from his many previous movies, like allowing the camera to sit still and capture the eerie silence that follows a massacre.
That stillness is a trademark of Anotsu (Sota Fukushi, terrific), the story’s big bad and also its most beautiful. Languid and slender, with an androgynous pout and a fondness for palest turquoise, the soft-voiced Anotsu leads his renegade army primarily by standing and posing.

Dick, accomplished something more unusual. It sent tendrils of influence — pictorial, conceptual and spiritual — into every corner of the culture and inspired a mystery cult.
Like other sacred texts, the film invites doctrinal arguments and esoteric inquiries. One of my fondest memories as a father and a film critic is of an impromptu post-screening seminar with two 11-year-olds about occult meanings and hidden clues in the director’s cut. How do we know (if indeed we do know) that Harrison Ford is a replicant? What is the significance of the origami unicorn? Are Sean Young’s shoulder pads for real?
[Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling Discuss “Blade Runner 2049”]
Alongside these basic interpretive questions, an academic subfield has blossomed, isolating “Blade Runner” as one of the original symptoms of postmodernism, a terminal and interminable disease of the mind. The film’s blend of curatorial nostalgia and dystopian prophecy captured a mood of self-conscious melancholy in its moment and set a tone of melancholy self-consciousness that has endured ever since. Maybe the real world never quite achieved the smoky neon-noir glow of Mr. Scott’s Los Angeles, but the map of our collective dream world was permanently redrawn.
The precise future “Blade Runner” projected is now less than two years away, and the next chapter, once something to be dreaded, seems, if anything, overdue. “Blade Runner 2049,” directed by Denis Villeneuve from a script by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, tries both to honor the original and to slip free of its considerable shadow. That’s no easy feat, and it’s worth noting right away that, in narrow movie terms, Mr. Villeneuve, who also directed “Arrival,” mostly succeeds. From the opening aerial shots of a thoroughly denatured agricultural landscape and the lethal confrontation that follows, we know we are in the presence of a masterly visual tactician and a shrewd storyteller.
[The “Blade Runner 2049” Look]
We are also in territory that is both familiar and disorienting. A brief note explains what has and hasn’t changed in the 30 years since the events in the first “Blade Runner.” Three-wheeled spinners still zoom through the California skies, and the building-size video advertisements have evolved into seductive, R-rated holograms. The titular profession — hunting down and “retiring” renegade members of the almost-human, genetically engineered android species known as replicants — is practiced with the same brutal doggedness as in the old days.
A new, more obedient type of replicant has been developed by a corporation led by a tech visionary played by Jared Leto. (His lieutenant Luv is played by Sylvia Hoeks, a far more vivid and persuasively terrifying presence than the mannered Mr. Leto.) One of these models is our hero, an L.A.P.D. employee known as K. (It’s an abbreviation of his serial number and also, maybe, an allusion to Franz Kafka’s avatar of modern alienation. That poor fellow’s full name was Josef K; when this K acquires a human pseudonym, it’s Joe.)
Speaking of avatars of alienation, K moves through his days with the unhurried shuffle and downcast baby blues of Ryan Gosling. This is impeccable casting. Mr. Gosling’s ability to elicit sympathy while seeming too distracted to want it — his knack for making boredom look like passion and vice versa — makes him a perfect warm-blooded robot for our time. He is also, in 2017, something close to what Harrison Ford was 35 years ago: the contemporary embodiment of Hollywood’s venerable ideal of masculine cool, a guy whose toughness will turn out to be the protective shell encasing a tender soul.
At first, of course, we must take that sensitivity on faith. K does his grim job thoroughly and without complaint, showing the weary, cynical patience of an old-time shamus. His commander (Robin Wright) is a human who believes that everything depends on policing the border between her kind and K’s. The whole point of “Blade Runner,” though, is that such boundaries are always blurred and porous. K comes home each night from work to the company of Joi (Ana de Armas), his devoted girlfriend, who happens to be a commercially produced artificial intelligence application.
We are prepared to acknowledge the pathos and the paradox of her condition, which is a version of K’s own. The idea that synthetic humans harbor feelings, desires and dreams — that they are mirrors of us, that we are replicas of them — has long been a staple of speculative cinema. “Blade Runner 2049” does not wander as deep into this ontological thicket as, say, Steven Spielberg’s “A.I.” or Spike Jonze’s “Her,” but like those movies it uses the conceit of the suffering cyborg as ethical and emotional ballast, a spur to the audience’s curiosity as well as our compassion. A political theme also asserts itself: These replicants are an enslaved labor force; their exploitation is the fuel on which this civilization runs.
There is a something to think about here, a fair amount to feel and even more to see. Mr. Villeneuve has conspired with the cinematographer, Roger A. Deakins; the production designer, Dennis Gassner; and the special effects team to create zones of strangeness that occasionally rise to the level of sublimity. The movies Mr. Villeneuve has directed — his recent English-language features include “Sicario,” “Prisoners” and “Arrival” — are full of violence and psychological intensity, but what distinguishes them from other high-end genre spectacles is an unnerving calm, as if he were exploring and trying to synthesize the human and mechanical sides of his own sensibility.
Movies are by their nature hybrids of technology and sentiment, machines for the delivery of human emotion. The first “Blade Runner” approached this as a philosophical problem and an artistic challenge. Mr. Scott used imagery borrowed from old Hollywood, German Expressionism and the nascent art of music video to create a dazzlingly artificial environment where authenticity was out of the question. Except, of course, that it was the question: How do we know what is real, ourselves included?
“I know what’s real,” says the hero of that movie when — at long last! — he shows up in this one. K finds Deckard, the original Blade Runner (Mr. Ford, as if I needed to tell you), in an abandoned Las Vegas casino, surrounded by shimmering bottles of whiskey and primitive 3-D projections of Elvis and Frank Sinatra. Mr. Gosling, suddenly overmatched in the masculine cool department, acquits himself well enough, and Mr. Ford does exactly what you expect him to do.
Which is not something I’m going to explain, at least as far as it relates to the story. The studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics not to reveal plot points. That’s fair enough, but it’s also evidence of how imaginatively impoverished big-budget movies have become. Like any great movie, Mr. Scott’s “Blade Runner” cannot be spoiled. It repays repeated viewing because its mysteries are too deep to be solved and don’t depend on the sequence of events. Mr. Villeneuve’s film, by contrast, is a carefully engineered narrative puzzle, and its power dissipates as the pieces snap into place. As sumptuous and surprising as it is from one scene to the next, it lacks the creative excess, the intriguing opacity and the haunting residue of its predecessor.
As such, “Blade Runner 2049” stands in relation to “Blade Runner” almost exactly as K stands in relation to Deckard before the two meet: as a more docile, less rebellious “improvement,” tweaked and retrofitted to meet consumer demand. And the customers are likely to be satisfied. But now and then — when K and Deckard are knocking around the old gambling palace; when K visits an enigmatic mind-technician played by Carla Juri — you get an inkling that something else might have been possible. Something freer, more romantic, more heroic, less determined by the corporate program.

The movie takes us all over China to see four species in their natural habitats, some of which are exceedingly remote. There are kitties — oh, all right; they’re snow leopards, a mother and two cubs. There’s a panda and her cub. There’s a young snub-nosed monkey that, at least in the irksome narrative imposed here, is feeling neglected because of the arrival of a baby sister.
A Tibetan antelope, or chiru, doesn’t get quite the screen time of these others — and isn’t even mentioned in some of the advance publicity for the movie — but footage of a long migration by the females of a herd to a calving ground and the arrival of a calf is among the most remarkable in the movie. Maybe that’s just because pandas and even the elusive snow leopard have become overexposed with the abundance of nature documentaries these days; this film looks pretty much like any of the best material to be found on the National Geographic Channel, PBS’s “Nature” and elsewhere.

It’s a fair enough question, not least because Brad is played by Ben Stiller, a frighteningly high-strung performer even at his mellowest. Mr. Stiller, lean as a greyhound and gray around the temples, occupies the volatile middle ground between decent fellow and abrasive jerk, between adequacy and failure. He’s a regular guy perpetually threatening to turn into that guy, embarrassing the rest of us by association.
In “Brad’s Status,” Mike White’s astute, cringy and ultimately kindhearted new film, Mr. Stiller undergoes a midlife crisis that has less to do with restlessness or lust than with a dreadful loss of perspective. Brad, who runs a small nonprofit, lives in a handsome Craftsman-style house on a leafy Sacramento block. His wife, Melanie (Jenna Fischer), who works in state government, is patient and devoted. Troy (Austin Abrams), a rising high school senior, is an excellent student, a gifted musician and an all-around good kid. Brad lives in a soft pocket of the American dream. He should be counting his blessings, or at least checking his privilege.
Instead, he dreams of the greener grass where his old college pals frolic, consumed with envy for their gilded, fast-track lives. As he and Troy prepare to head east for a tour of potential colleges — Brad, who went to Tufts, is amazed to learn that his son is Harvard material — he is seized by anxieties that quickly migrate from the practical to the existential. The question of whether he and Melanie will have enough money for Troy’s tuition gives way to a resentful reckoning with his peers. How come he doesn’t have as much as they do?
These four men occupy a prime parcel of professional, personal and actual real estate. Nick (Mr. White), is a Hollywood director whose house has recently been featured on the cover of a glossy shelter rag. Jason (Luke Wilson) is a hedge-fund mogul with a bevy of blond kids and a private jet. Billy (Jemaine Clement), having made a fortune in tech, now lives in polyamorous retirement on a beach in Maui. Craig (Michael Sheen) has parlayed a political career into best-selling authorship and television celebrity.
What do they have that Brad lacks? Where did he go wrong? Why does he only rate a worthless silver airline rewards card, instead of gold or platinum? He ruminates on these and related matters in long passages of voice-over narration, brought back to reality by the ringing of his cellphone or the needs of his son.
Brad also reconnects with his old friends — three of the four, at least — who drop hints that they may have problems of their own. Everybody does. And Mr. White is committed to giving everyone a fair hearing. He specializes in exquisitely awkward scenes made more so by his evenhanded sympathy. In one especially acute moment, Brad unburdens himself to a Harvard undergraduate named Ananya (Shazi Raja) who is a friend of Troy’s from back home. Rather than singing harmony with Brad’s white man’s blues, she rebukes him for his unthinking white male entitlement. “You’re 50 years old and you still think the world was made for you,” she marvels.
She has a point. So does he. His angst is real, as are the gradations of social hierarchy that cause it. But in the bigger picture, his misery is trivial. Mr. White could easily have loaded the satiric dice, emphasizing Brad’s Gen-X self-absorption or Ananya’s millennial self-righteousness, but he suspends judgment, leaving the viewer hanging in an exquisitely uncomfortable limbo. What are we supposed to think? We’re supposed to think for ourselves.
And “Brad’s Status” at its best is genuinely thought-provoking. As a writer, television creator and director — his résumé includes “Beatriz at Dinner,” “Year of the Dog” and the HBO series “Enlightened” — Mr. White has honed a comic sensibility that avoids cruelty and minimizes exaggeration. He is attuned to the political implications of individual behavior and also to those aspects of experience that can’t be politicized. His characters are bundles of contradictory impulses and qualities. They are admirable and awful, full of idealism and full of themselves, weird and entirely familiar.
Sometimes you might wish he pushed them harder. “Brad’s Status,” a worthy addition to the burgeoning genre of empty-nest movies, smooths more feathers than it ruffles. In spite of Mr. Stiller’s displays of doubt and discomfort, the movie protects him from humiliation and finds a safe space for Brad’s bruised ego. There is something a little disappointing about this, but also something honest, since the movie’s message is that what looks like disappointment should be embraced as the only real happiness there is." 0.626090477 "Comedy" "R" "Annapurna Pictures" "" "$89,921 " "$2,133,158 " "" "3" "4-Dec-09" "29-Apr-10" "147" 21

That rural town was light-years away from the Manhattan home of the CBS studio, where Orson Welles was retelling H. G. Wells’s novel “The War of the Worlds” in an infamous radio production on Oct. 30, 1938. Those unaware that the broadcast was a work of fiction fell for Wells’s story of an alien invasion. Fear that it was real quickly set off a panic.
In Jody Lambert’s lighthearted comedy “Brave New Jersey” panic is positive, pushing people to say or do things they may have never done under ordinary circumstances. Out of the ensuing chaos, the town’s bashful mayor (Tony Hale, from “Veep”) is forced to assert himself, and a pastor’s faith is challenged, as is the relationship between a schoolteacher and her new fiancé.
Through its many cheerful characters, “Brave New Jersey” emanates an upbeat attitude of a James Stewart kind. With its warm filters and costumes, the movie emulates a period film, but its sharp digital cinematography is at odds with its softer, vintage aesthetic.
Mr. Lambert, who wrote the screenplay with Michael Dowling, aims for a modest, old-fashioned yarn about a time when people believed in the news media. Even when word gets out that the Martian invasion announcement was just part of a radio show, not everyone listens as intently as they did to the original radio program and gossip. The film’s narrative simplicity can be charming or frustrating, depending on your feelings about awkward dialogue and overreacting actors." 0.868406831 "Comedy" "Unrated" "Gravitas Ventures" "" "$4,891 " "$16,413 " "$368,901 " "84" "10-Dec-10" "16-Dec-10" "7" 1

After contracting the disease in the 1950s at the age of 28, Cavendish, paralyzed from the neck down and expected to live only a few months, not only beat those odds by almost 40 years, but regained his independence. He was also instrumental in helping other severely disabled patients regain theirs, collaborating with his friend Teddy (Hugh Bonneville), an amateur inventor, to design a wheelchair with a built-in ventilator and traveling to Europe to promote its use.
This exceptional life, however, is smothered by a cloying fairy tale romance that turns every challenge the couple faces into a lark. (Silly dog, unplugging Daddy’s breathing machine!) Their charmed existence includes a huge country house, a free nanny and friends who are forever popping over for wine-soaked parties. Not even a broken respirator, which strands the family on a Spanish roadside, can halt the fun: Within minutes, an impromptu fiesta, complete with guitarists and flamenco dancers, has materialized to keep them company.
Offering no hint of the backbreaking drudgery and mental strain of their predicament, this gauzy picture (produced by the couple’s son, Jonathan Cavendish, and directed by his friend, the actor Andy Serkis) is a closed loop of rose-tinted memories. Similarly constrained, Mr. Garfield smiles broadly through episodes of near-suffocation and bloody sputum, while Ms. Foy embodies the buck-up-and-carry-on mentality that William Nicholson’s screenplay demands.
In only one scene do we feel genuinely moved, as Robin and Diana visit a German hospital where polio patients are housed in a futuristic nightmare of iron-lung efficiency. It’s a rebel moment of chillingly authentic horror that seems to have slipped through every bad-feeling filter the filmmakers have installed.

The sight of her working up a sweat in this fashion is what audience members initially see as they file into the performance space where her solo show is being staged, and she continues for quite some time after they are seated.
“When something is going on for so long, there’s a transformation,” she explains in an interview that is intercut throughout the director Andrew Rossi’s documentary, also called “Bronx Gothic,” about Ms. Okpokwasili and her work.
The stage piece (reviewed in The New York Times in 2014) uses dance, song and spoken word, combined with various forms of stagecraft. Ms. Okpokwasili’s fearless writing and intense, virtuosic performance style make the story, of two black girls discovering their sexuality while growing up in the Bronx, seem torn from her own life. (The piece is not autobiographical, however.) Ideas of female and black beauty are explored with language that is frequently profane — hardly any of it is quotable here — and always charged. The narrative unfolds via a series of letters Ms. Okpokwasili reads from, but her words are punctuated by movements that are at times balletic, at other times pure James Brown meets punk rock. She hits the stage floor hard, and more than once.
The movie shows her interacting with audience members in Q. and A. sessions during a tour of the piece, doting on her lovely daughter and having pointed discussions about race with her husband, Peter Born — who is white and also the director of the stage work. These scenes are interesting and sometimes genuinely illuminating. Mr. Born can be a bit pedantic when speaking with his wife about “black victimhood” in popular culture, citing “12 Years a Slave” as an example that seems to irritate him.
Ms. Okpokwasili doesn’t say much in response, but her face indicates a certain impatience with Mr. Born’s view. Later in the film the family visits Ms. Okpokwasili’s parents, who are Nigerian immigrants. They are somewhat hesitant to watch a video of their daughter’s piece. Once they do, though, Ms. Okpokwasili’s mother likens her daughter’s style of movement to Nigerian dance, and gives a demonstration that’s both moving and revealing.
In the end, Ms. Okpokwasili’s often academic-sounding exegeses of her work become repetitive. Given the aesthetically confrontational nature of the piece, one can understand why Mr. Rossi did not attempt an undiluted cinematic translation of the complete “Bronx Gothic.” But something about his approach (which I assume was approved by Ms. Okpokwasili, as she is one of the movie’s executive producers) feels, finally, like an evasion." 0.947066896 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Grasshopper Film" "" "$10,110 " "$87,433 " "$12,353,768 " "" "" "" "" NA

Upon hearing a particularly great tune, he would ask two questions: “Who wrote it?” and “Is he or she still alive?”
At that time, so many of the writers and players and singers were indeed still alive. Ibrahim Ferrer, the singer referred to in Mr. Wenders’s movie as “the Cuban Nat King Cole,” was making a meager living shining shoes a few blocks down the street from the studio where Mr. Cooder and Juan de Marcos González were working on what would become the 1997 album “Buena Vista Social Club.” That record, and Mr. Wenders’s subsequent film, made international stars out of Mr. Ferrer and several other Cuban musicians who had thought time and the world had passed them by.
“Buena Vista Social Club: Adios,” directed by Lucy Walker (and of which Mr. Wenders, among others, is an executive producer) is both an exemplary sequel and a vital, informative companion piece. It not only chronicles the late-life careers of the “Buena Vista” stars, many of whom have since died. But it also tells some painful and fascinating back stories, and insists on putting the music in its social and historical contexts.
Mr. Wenders’s film didn’t do much of that; it was content to be a kind of hangout movie, capturing musicians playing dominoes while awaiting their turns at the microphone. “Adios” shows furious arguments at sound checks and reveals the ambivalence with which some of the musicians viewed newfound fame. It’s not as poetic or immediately enjoyable as the first film.

(The maggot mousse might be pushing it.)
The movie follows Ben Reade, a chef, and Josh Evans, a researcher, then both of the Nordic Food Lab in Denmark, as they travel the world to visit cultures where insects are prepared as food. (Roberto Flore, another chef, joins the trip later.) The Nordic lab, a project initiated by Claus Meyer and René Redzepi, founders of the foodie polestar Noma, has a mission to explore “food diversity and deliciousness.” The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has reported that the use of insects as food may have long-term benefits for the global food supply. It also offers cooks new possibilities for tastes and textures. (If you thought using whole animals was trendy, just wait until you try dishes that use multiple developmental stages.)
As they pay visits to Australia, Kenya, Uganda, Mexico and Japan, Mr. Reade and Mr. Evans are effectively M.C.s on the world’s weirdest episode of “Iron Chef.” (“To be honest, I would rather a normal Camembert,” Mr. Reade confesses after sampling casu marzu, a maggot-infested cheese from Italy.)

Strange, then, that “Burden,” a documentary about this artist, plays it safe. This is a film unafraid to look at his acts, but timid when approaching his ideas.
Burden, who created large sculptures late in his career, was best known for his early performance pieces, among them “Shoot,” from 1971. In it, a friend fired a rifle at him from a few yards away. The intent was to graze Burden’s upper left arm; instead, the bullet went through it.
“Trans-fixed,” from 1974, featured the artist nailed to a car, while other pieces had him further punishing his body and making it, along with his pain, a kind of canvas and paint.
Questions instantly arise: Is this really art? What exactly is art supposed to do? Yet interviews with Burden and others shy away from arguments — few dissenters are given a say, and are essentially dismissed. True, discussions of art tend to be subjective and open-ended. But these works were made to be debated with a passion that is sometimes lacking here.
Timothy Marrinan and Richard Dewey, the directors, were close to their subject — in a Q. and A. on the movie’s website, they talk of gaining Burden’s trust and developing a relationship with him. Their dedication to his career is praiseworthy, and their film recommendable for its devotion to the artist, who died in 2015.

Long known to the authorities as Buster, he calls in to radio shows to rant about a coming apocalypse.
Once, in another life, Buster was a loving husband and father called Jonah and a sleep-deprived night clerk at a characterless hotel. Between the two identities lies a dreadful, transformative event; and as the movie toggles from one to the other, its writer and director, Sarah Adina Smith, conjures a storyboard of surreal puzzle pieces that snap together then suddenly split apart. So when a mysterious stranger (DJ Qualls) seems to offer Jonah freedom from his puritanical in-laws and soul-deadening job, we somehow know that escape is not on the table.
Filmed with an alienating elegance by Shaheen Seth, “Buster’s Mal Heart” is about the making of a madman. It also aspires, with less success, to philosophically query the void at the center of modern life and Christianity’s failure to fill it. Religious homilies and paranoid exhortations spill from television sets where cartoons of men trapped in endlessly whirring machines dance dishearteningly. And if the story is too tricky to realize its themes or welcome the impatient, it also contains enough empathy to humanize a character who’s part man, part spiritual symbol.
That character is only a step away from Mr. Malek’s delusional-hacker role on the television series “Mr. Robot,” his gigantic eyes and repressed manner the movie’s greatest assets.

It’s really about how we create art.
Sinking into a dedicated — and overwhelmingly male — subculture of enthusiasts, the director Doug Nichol unearths a trove of reasons for loving the clicketyclacking machine. The playwright and actor Sam Shepard (who died last month) confesses an addiction to the percussive sound of thoughts striking paper. Tom Hanks, an avid collector who owns around 250 machines and types almost daily, declares that he hates emailed thank-you notes and simply deletes them. Take note, sycophants and star-stalkers.
More substantively, the musician John Mayer and the historian David McCullough speak eloquently of the need for tangible proof of creation versus the ephemeral nature of digital data. Denied diaries, letters or first drafts — whether of songs or presidential speeches — future historians will find it much harder to plumb the minds of the famous.

His best-known titles, “I Am Love” and “A Bigger Splash,” feature beautiful people with impeccable taste experiencing haute-bourgeois life intensely. Passion and drama upend those lives, but what’s most striking about these movies is their extraordinary palpable quality. In Mr. Guadagnino’s work, passion and drama are expressed in words, deeds and surging music but also in the vibrant, visceral textures that envelop his characters — the cool marble, succulent fruit, shadow and light, sheens of sweat. These are movies that turn your gaze into near-touch, inviting you to see and almost caress their sun-warmed bodies.
Mr. Guadagnino’s latest, “Call Me by Your Name,” is another ravishment of the senses, though this time there’s a strong narrative tethering all the churning feelings and sensuous surfaces. Like the 2007 novel by André Aciman on which it’s based, the story turns on an affair between Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), a coltish 17-year-old American-Italian, and Oliver (Armie Hammer), an American in his 20s. Elio lives with his father (a tremendous Michael Stuhlbarg) and mother (Amira Casar) in a villa in northern Italy. Each summer the father, a professor of Greco-Roman culture, invites a student to work with him and stay with his family; this year it’s Oliver who moves in.
Elio and Oliver’s affair begins slowly with each circling the other at a distance, conveying the kind of nonchalance that’s a shield for interest. Oliver proves far better at this part of the game; he knows more than to look too long and too hard. Elio’s furtive, ducking glances, by contrast, tend to linger, hovering in the air like questions. He’s increasingly curious about this new guest, but soon inexplicably (to Elio, at least) irked by him as well, leading Elio to complain to his parents about Oliver’s standard signoff (“later”). But when Elio scribbles a private rebuke in a notebook, chastising himself for responding harshly toward Oliver, it’s as if he were writing an apologetic love letter.
Mr. Guadagnino is very good at catching the indolent drift of long summer days, with their sleepiness and bared limbs. Everyone seems to move in slow motion at the villa, except perhaps the family’s hard-working maid. This languor fits the tempo of Elio and Oliver’s relationship, which evolves over meals, drowsy idylls, a little work and a spontaneous piano recital that becomes an overture to seduction. A gifted musician, Elio easily moves from piano to guitar (much as his family shifts from speaking Italian to French to English), talent that makes him seem at one with the villa’s miles of bookshelves, its velvet sofas, scattered Oriental rugs and tastefully arranged antiques.
It’s an alluring milieu — charming, civilized and perfectly, if a shade too flawlessly, arranged. Here, even a busy breakfast table and the fruit on a tree can seem art directed. Mr. Guadagnino almost can’t help making everything look intoxicating, yet he also makes you believe in this family’s reality. The grand piano isn’t for show and neither are the books or the open affection and respect with which Elio and his parents treat one another. (The movie reminds you how rarely characters read for pleasure, much less listen to classical music.) “Call Me by Your Name” is set in 1983, so no one is staring into a smartphone. And the time frame means that AIDS doesn’t figure in the story, though there’s a suggestion that the closet does.
The story primarily unfolds through Elio’s point of view. The restless camera tags alongside him, showing you what he sees, his erotic reveries and yearning. And it’s Elio who initiates the affair, at least overtly, though Oliver later admits to playing his part in what the story frames as a mutual seduction. Mr. Guadagnino avoids directly engaging the difference in Elio and Oliver’s ages, which might have forced him to explore the underside of his sumptuous surfaces to greater, messier effect. Instead, Mr. Guadagnino leans on beauty, as when Elio’s father poetically speaks to an increasingly agitated Oliver about the “ageless ambiguity” of some male statues (“as if they’re daring you to desire them”).
Written by James Ivory (the director of films like “Maurice”), “Call Me by Your Name” progresses through evasions and encounters, with Elio advancing, Oliver receding and their circling narrowing. The two don’t (can’t, won’t) always say what they mean. So Mr. Guadagnino speaks for them by eroticizing their world, making desire visible in the luxuriousness of the setting, in the green enveloping the villa, the gushing waters of a pool and the graceful lines of male statues. When Oliver hungrily eats a soft-boiled egg, cracking the shell and causing the yolk to messily spurt, Mr. Guadagnino’s lyricism slides into comedy; it’s hard to know just how self-mocking the moment is meant to be.
Even so, the lyricism seduces as does fragile, ecstatic Elio. “Call Me by Your Name” is less a coming-of-age story, a tale of innocence and loss, than one about coming into sensibility. In that way, it is about the creation of a new man who, the story suggests, is liberated by pleasure that doesn’t necessarily establish sexual identity. It’s important that Elio and Oliver have relationships with women, though for seemingly different reasons: the overheated Elio sleeps with a girlfriend (Esther Garrel), while Oliver carries on a more performative affair with a local (Victoire Du Bois). The women are not treated with much kindness, but these affairs further complicate the movie’s vision of pleasure’s fluidity.
There are moments when Mr. Guadagnino’s visual choices seem unintentionally in competition with the quieter, intricate emotions that his actors put across so movingly. He can be discreet to the point of coyness (bodies sweat but don’t necessarily grunt), but it is finally the insistent delicacy and depth of emotion that makes these characters so heart-skippingly tender. The charismatic Mr. Chalamet, Mr. Hammer and Mr. Stuhlbarg — whose brilliant delivery of a tricky speech pierces the heart and, crucially, the movie’s lustrous patina — transform beauty into feeling. In one alive, vulnerable and life-altering summer, Elio’s desire finds its purpose. He loves, and in loving, he becomes." 0.994995072 "Drama" "R" "Sony Classics" "" "" "" "" "6" "26-Jan-07" "11-Feb-07" "17" 2.4

Koontz, is nothing if not an exhaustive compendium of fright-film motifs. The story concerns Jack Zeller (Christopher Denham), a photographer with post-traumatic stress disorder who returns to his Midwestern hometown from a combat assignment in the Middle East, only to receive a camera whose pictures, when developed, depict murder victims within Jack’s compositions. Soon Jack is killing people himself — ostensibly to save others at risk (his motivation is murky) — and staging the crime scenes to resemble the images in the photos.
His mental unraveling in “Camera Obscura” somewhat echoes those in many horror outings (including, for starters, “The Shining” and “Repulsion”). Other similarities to earlier movies abound, including a killer on grainy old videotape (à la “V/H/S/2”); spectral photographic phenomena (shades of “Shutter”); a soupçon of torture porn (as in the “Saw” and “Hostel” movies); dashes of morbid humor; and that hardy perennial the kitchen knife (but a special Tanaka knife). A flashback to Jack’s battle trauma adds a modicum of social commentary. Centipedes make cameo appearances, while intimations of child abuse and stalking are wholly gratuitous.
Fortunately, “Camera Obscura” has decent actors to flesh out its dubious premise, not least Mr. Denham (“Billions”). As Jack’s fiancée, Nadja Bobyleva has an appealing range, and Catherine Curtin (soon to be in the second season of “Stranger Things”) ably portrays a skeptical police detective.

If your child would be amused by seeing the word “underpants” in the name of a movie, this one will entertain. The film, based on Dav Pilkey’s book series, is about two friends, George (voiced by Kevin Hart) and Harold (Thomas Middleditch), who spend their spare time pulling pranks and creating D.I.Y. comic books about Captain Underpants, a superhero whose outfit boldly acknowledges that many superhero costumes in fact are little more than fancy undies.
The boys’ nemesis is Mr. Krupp (Ed Helms), the school principal. Maybe someone has made a kids’ movie with a principal who isn’t buffoonish or heartless, but here the stereotypes are embraced with a vengeance.

There are some who think Pixar should aim for awe-inspiring every time, because why not? Then there are crankier critics who will point out that driverless talking cars just aren’t terribly interesting, and can be a little goofy.
“Cars 3,” directed by Brian Fee from a script by Kiel Murray, Bob Peterson and Mike Rich (the story is credited to a whole other pit crew that includes Mr. Fee), isn’t going to win any converts among those with an animus toward talking cars. But if you can roll with it, the movie is both breezy fun and a pain-free life lesson delivery vehicle.
It begins predictably, with the cheerful, cherry red Lightning McQueen (voiced with the usual winning pep by Owen Wilson) about to zip across another finish line in first place. Except he doesn’t win — he’s beaten by a new, sleek, black-with-purple-highlights racer by the name of Jackson Storm. This brash rookie, who is voiced with apt smarm by Armie Hammer, oozes, “I can’t believe I get to race Lightning McQueen in his farewell season.” Lightning notes that it’s not his farewell season and … well, you get the idea.
“The racing world is changing,” a friend advises Lightning, and our hero makes a small effort to adapt. Hooking up with a new corporate sponsor, he starts his off-season training at a top-tier site where, apparently, newbies such as Jackson Storm tone up. There, he’s introduced to a plucky performance coach, a yellow car named Cruz Ramirez (voiced by Cristela Alonzo). She responds to Lightning’s frequent angry, pessimistic outbursts with an instruction to “Use that!”
For a while, the movie is content to poke mild fun at America’s enthusiasm for trendy self-help bromides and computer-age enhancement technology. There’s a mild paradox that this entirely digital movie waxes so nostalgic for analog-age stuff: Art Deco diners, big-knob radios, funky garages. Lightning frequently flashes back to the advice and companionship of his old mentor, Doc Hudson (voiced by the great Paul Newman in the first “Cars” movie in 2006, two years before his death, and who is again heard here). Acting on those memories, Lightning eventually persuades Cruz to get out and train with him, old-school style, at a nearby beach.
It’s here that the movie’s pedagogic mode starts, gently, to kick in. Lightning begins to realize that maybe he really is too old to be a champion on the track anymore — so what’s next? And Cruz reveals her thwarted ambition to be a racer, a dream she abandoned out of fear the first time she was told to take her shot. In a quiet but ultimately forceful way, “Cars 3” makes a case against sexism and for the joys of mentorship. Because the “Cars” franchise has been Lightning’s story, the male lead is, by that logic, the initial force moving the female-empowerment theme. That may strike some as a little patronizing. But the Cruz-Lightning dynamic eventually evolves into a genuine friendship that has a lot of appeal.
Along the way, entertaining set pieces, such as a visit to a demolition derby gone wrong, and an evening trading war stories with a group of older racecars headed by Doc Hudson’s guru, a truck named Smokey (voiced by Chris Cooper), keep the story humming quite comfortably. It all builds to a climax that’s entirely satisfying and not particularly overwhelming. And that’s fine. As someone who was nearly traumatized by “Toy Story 3” and reduced to a sniveling wreck by much of “Inside Out,” I welcome the occasional Pixar movie that doesn’t morph me into a quivering jelly mound.
And the lessons are right-on, for adults as well as children. One more thing: If you’re intimidated by the movie’s running time, note that the feature is preceded by a short, “Lou,” which is very sweet and charming, and also that, as is customary with a Pixar movie, the end credits take a while." 0.978736373 "Animation" "G" "Buena Vista" "" "$53,688,680 " "$152,901,115 " "" "1,917" "17-Sep-93" "" "" NA

(His music, the philosopher Cornel West says in the film, was more of a thermostat than a thermometer.) But as a biographical movie, “Chasing Trane” sticks to a conventional, dully informative format. Its ideal venue is a Coltrane tribute event or a classroom.
The director, John Scheinfeld (“The U.S. vs. John Lennon”), has amassed a wide array of Mr. Coltrane’s collaborators, friends, influences and chroniclers (including Ben Ratliff, formerly of The New York Times). But for every talking head with serious musical insight, like Wynton Marsalis, we get another like Bill Clinton — a jazz fan, but probably mostly present because he was too prominent to cut.
The film shows other signs of injudicious editing. “We were there for a reason, which was to create beautiful music,” says the pianist McCoy Tyner of playing with the John Coltrane Quartet, adding with a laugh, “I use the word ‘beautiful’ because I can’t think of a better word.” Carlos Santana and John Densmore, the Doors’ drummer, offer fawning platitudes.
More productive, this film includes Mr. Coltrane’s performances, along with home movies, family interviews and the musician’s own words, read by Denzel Washington. Occasionally it delves into musical analysis, discussing how spirituality and events (the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, a 1966 visit to Nagasaki) affected Mr. Coltrane’s compositions, style and shows.

While the film includes footage of Ms. Vargas onstage and recordings of her music, it doesn’t convey the power of her artistry, giving the viewer a sense of why, to paraphrase the musician Miguel Bosé from the film, listeners might believe that she could die from being overwhelmed in the middle of a song. (Separately, we learn that may have been her wish.)
Ms. Vargas was born in Costa Rica, moved to Mexico as a child and died there in 2012 at age 93. The movie’s centerpiece is footage of Ms. Vargas speaking for herself, in material that Ms. Gund shot in 1991. These candid conversations have been supplemented with the usual array of photos and talking heads — people who knew Ms. Vargas from collaborations, love and friendship — along with a rundown of the singer’s life.
Although she became known for her performances of ranchera, especially songs by the composer José Alfredo Jiménez, Ms. Vargas eschewed the flamboyant hoop skirts and jewelry associated with performers of the genre, wearing pants and earning a reputation for, as it’s described in the film, “singing like a man.” She didn’t come out as a lesbian until the age of 81, but according to the film, her sexuality was no secret. We hear about how she swooned over Frida Kahlo, among many other women. Severe alcoholism stalled her career, until a cabaret performance in Mexico City in the early 1990s rekindled the spark and eventually led to fresh international acclaim. (She did not perform much in the United States; The New York Times interviewed her in 2003 on the occasion of her Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 83.)
“Chavela lived in a continual state of farewell,” says the director Pedro Almodóvar, who befriended the singer in her later life and used her songs in some of his films.

Mr. Schreiber has his own ideas about which real-life figures he should be playing. He is both the star and a producer of “Chuck,” a biopic of Chuck Wepner, a New Jersey-born-and-bred boxer (nicknamed, to his chagrin, the Bayonne Bleeder), whose improbable 1975 bout with Muhammad Ali inspired Sylvester Stallone’s screenplay for “Rocky.”
Mr. Schreiber has almost no physical resemblance to Wepner, in his heyday a burly, mustachioed redhead. Mr. Schreiber is a terrific actor, however, and he pulls it off. His portrayal works partly because of its understatement. He doesn’t try to Jersey things up too much, so to speak; nor does Elisabeth Moss, as the philandering boxer’s long-suffering wife. Naomi Watts, on the other hand, playing a later love of Wepner’s, clearly relishes the opportunity to perform in a vintage glitter sweater and painted-on jeans.
Wepner’s story is not entirely unfamiliar. In the movie, credited to four screenwriters (including Mr. Schreiber), and directed by Philippe Falardeau, Wepner is a more or less lovable rapscallion, whose relentless post-Ali-bout partying features a disastrous introduction to cocaine. A derailed stint in showbiz, courtesy of Mr. Stallone, and some trouble with the law follow.
This is a pretty good boxing picture, with credible redemption notes, but one character could be summing up the whole enterprise when she says to Chuck: “There’s more to you than meets the eye.

His accuracy-in-metaphor was such that sufferers of subsequent generations have frequently adopted the term.
The movie’s ambition is the good news. The bad news is that it is a hash, choosing to jumble the historical record and frame a Churchill bout with depression against the D-Day invasion of France by Allied forces. While Churchill did express serious reservations about the operation in the weeks before it occurred, he was largely reconciled to the plan by the time it happened. This movie has Churchill, played with both grim determination and wild abandon by Brian Cox, railing against the high command in terms and gestures that mostly suggest a poorly run group therapy session.
In some bad movies, a consolation prize comes when the actors are able to transcend, or just steamroll, the weak material and serve up performance pleasures. But to watch John Slattery as Dwight D. Eisenhower bark at Mr. Cox’s Churchill about not hosting Churchill’s “amateur theatrics” because “there’s a war on!” is to witness the sorry spectacle of an actor utterly defeated by his script.

There, Harun — the inspiration for a caliph in “One Thousand and One Nights” — is said to have played polo and perfumed the air with garments worn by female slaves. Raqqa’s later history largely registers as more mundane, a tale of declines and revivals that turned catastrophic when the Islamic State, or ISIS, seized it in 2014, making the city its effective capital. American-backed forces are currently battling ISIS for control of a city in ruins.
“City of Ghosts,” a blunt instrument of a documentary, is an urgent and heart-heavy account of Syrian resistance from the ground up. Specifically, it recounts the story and activism of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, or R.B.S.S., a citizen-journalist initiative that emerged in April 2014 to secretly record the atrocities committed by ISIS in Raqqa. (R.B.S.S.’s website states that the group is nonpartisan and explains that it is “a campaign launched by a group of nonviolent activists in Raqqa to expose the atrocities committed by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and terrorist extremist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria” toward civilians in that city.)
Directed by Matthew Heineman, “City of Ghosts” primarily focuses on three R.B.S.S. activists identified by their first names — Aziz, Hamoud and Mohamad — who, even after being forced to flee Raqqa, intently work to get images and information about the city out into the world. Mr. Heineman, who is also the movie’s cinematographer, more or less opens and closes the documentary in 2015 with some of the activists in New York, where R.B.S.S. received an award from the nonprofit group the Committee to Protect Journalists. It’s a distracting framing device that suggests Mr. Heineman believed that he first needed to give his audience reassuringly recognizable faces. Cut to David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, at the podium.
“City of Ghosts” is best when it lets the activists tell their own stories, which they do in smoothly edited tag-team voice-over, in on-camera scenes from their life abroad and in ghastly underground images recorded in Raqqa. It’s an account of heroic resistance that essentially begins in 2011 when the Arab Spring reached Syria (“we started to scream for freedom”), and peaceful demonstrations against President Assad were met with state violence followed by power grabs. Along the way, Mr. Heineman furnishes a sketchy look at the various players and geopolitical stakes, glossing over Syria’s historical complexities and the role that the United States has played in the rise of ISIS.
The activists come across as ordinary men made extraordinary by circumstance; some seem almost surprised at where life and war have taken them. Aziz was a student who became a spokesman, and Mohamad was a teacher turned reporter, but not much else about the group’s origins comes through. Mr. Heineman glides over the nuts and bolts of its operational beginning. He may not have thought it germane, or maybe thought covering it might have endangered lives. Or perhaps Mr. Heineman, an excitingly visceral director — his last documentary was “Cartel Land” — thought it might slow this fast-paced feature down. Like the Arab Spring represented in the movie, R.B.S.S. almost seems to have spontaneously erupted.
That’s unfortunate because more information and in-depth analysis, as well as greater restraint in the use of atrocity images, might have deepened a movie that leans on shortcuts and visual shocks. In “City of Ghosts,” Mr. Heineman marshals some incredible material — including on-the-run undercover cellphone imagery — into a moving record of extraordinary individual and collective heroism, one that eventually emphasizes the personal over the political. You admire Aziz, Hamoud, Mohamad and their partisan compatriots. And soon you fear for them too, worrying over their every move as they fight an enemy that is scarily near. Yet as these men come into the focus, Raqqa and the region recede.
As the activists struggle to keep Raqqa alive for the world, funneling news to outside agencies, the dead in this movie — decapitated, crucified, shot — come close to overwhelming the living. In a few instances, Mr. Heineman shows men being shot point blank in the head; elsewhere, he cuts way before the fatal moment, which turns these murders into appalling cinematic cliffhangers. He seems to believe that it’s crucial to include numerous unfiltered ISIS atrocities, but raw and blurred versions of savagery prove this false. Mr. Heineman is clearly passionate and sincere, but he doesn’t fully grasp the power of suggestion or the audience’s capacity for empathy.

Sometimes you witness a big, bold breakthrough, like the computer-assisted rendering of fur in “Monsters, Inc.,” of water in “Finding Nemo,” or of metal in “Cars.” The innovations in “Coco” are no less satisfying for being of a more subtle kind. The grain of leather and the rusted folds of corrugated metal have a rough, almost tactile quality. Human bones, hairless dogs and orange flower petals look uncannily (but not too uncannily) real. There are moments of cinematic rigor — when the animators mimic the movements and focal effects of an old-fashioned camera in actual physical space — that will warm any film-geek’s heart. Not to mention the Frida Kahlo-inspired musical number with dancing papaya seeds.
“Coco” is also one of those Pixar movies that attempt a conceptual breakthrough, an application of the bright colors and open emotionalism of modern, mainstream animation to an unlikely zone of experience. From the very start, the studio has explored the inner lives of inanimate objects like lamps and toys with a tenderness we now take for granted. It has also summoned the post-human future (“Wall-E”) and the human unconscious (“Inside/Out”) with breathtaking ingenuity. And now it has set out to make a family-friendly cartoon about death.
Don’t let that scare you or your children away. There is a murder (revealed in the third act) and a fatal church-bell-related accident (witnessed in the first), but the afterlife in “Coco” is a warm and hectic place, more comical than creepy. The story takes place during the Day of the Dead, when according to Mexican tradition (at least as interpreted by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina, who directed the screenplay written by Mr. Molina and Matthew Aldrich), the border controls between life and death relax and the departed are allowed temporary passage to the land of the living. A young boy named Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) makes the trip in reverse, which is not to say that he dies, but rather that his living self, through one of several metaphysical loopholes that the movie explains as it goes along, is transported into a fantastical world of specters and skeletons, who hold fabulous parties and raucous outdoor concerts.
Nearly as enchanting as that magical realm is the Mexican village of Santa Cecilia, Miguel’s hometown, where he is part of a prosperous clan of shoemakers. The cultural vibe of “Coco” is inclusive rather than exoticizing, pre-empting inevitable concerns about authenticity and appropriation with the mixture of charm and sensitivity that has become something of a 21st-century Disney hallmark. Here, the importance of family — the multigenerational household that sustains and constrains the hero — is both specific and universal. It’s what explains the particular beats of Miguel’s story and what connects him to viewers regardless of background.
He shows a certain kinship with other well-known recent cartoon characters. A gifted musician in a family that forbids music, he is a bit like Remy, the “Ratatouille” rat whose kin were hostile to his artistic ambition, and like Mumble, the misfit penguin in “Happy Feet.” Miguel’s genealogical quest — a search for roots, lost ancestors and information that might explain who he is — resembles Dory’s journey in “Finding Dory.” The sidekicks who accompany him, animal and (formerly) human, are drawn from a familiar well of archetypes, and the final round of lesson-learning and reconciliation hits notes we have heard many times before.
But if “Coco” doesn’t quite reach the highest level of Pixar masterpieces, it plays a time-tested tune with captivating originality and flair, and with roving, playful pop-culture erudition. Miguel’s musical role model — and the source of the family embargo on musical expression — is a long-dead crooner and movie star named Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). In life and in death, he incarnates venerable ideals of romance and wounded machismo, or at least their show-business incarnations. (His greatest hits and movie clips form part of the texture of “Coco,” the way the old “Woody’s Roundup” show did in the “Toy Story” movies.)
The purer embodiment of that tradition is Héctor (Gael García Bernal), a ragged, forgotten ghost who befriends Miguel. What links Héctor with de la Cruz is a lurid story of passion, betrayal and longing. Their lives and deaths are a ballad whose meaning and melody Miguel must learn. In doing so, he will understand the thread that links him to both of them, and also the sources of the anti-musical animus that runs so strongly in his maternal line.
Coco is the name of Miguel’s great-grandmother, who turns out to be the heart of the story. Her mother, Imelda (Alanna Noël Ubach), is a furious matriarch on the other side of the grave, while Coco’s daughter, Miguel’s Abuelita (Renée Victor), is a no-nonsense flesh-and-blood autocrat. Their determination to silence Miguel’s guitar arises from heartbreak, and from the instrument’s association with the waywardness of men.
“Coco” avoids the darker tones associated with this theme, in the way that old murder ballads are sometimes reconceived as children’s songs. It’s reassuring rather than haunting, which is a shrewd and successful commercial compromise, but a compromise all the same." 0.998959361 "Animation" "PG" "Buena Vista" "" "$50,802,605 " "" "" "1,800" "4-Sep-98" "" "" NA

Columbus’s claim to fame — other than being Vice President Mike Pence’s hometown — is that it’s an unlikely haven for modernist architecture. Through a combination of patronage and civic courtship, this southern Indiana city became a home to structures by Eliel Saarinen, I. M. Pei, Robert A. M. Stern, Richard Meier and many others.
Against this backdrop, Kogonada, a video essayist who has made artful film-analysis shorts for the Criterion Collection and Sight & Sound magazine, has shot a modest two-hander, using the architecture as a springboard for larger questions, much as his shorts are meta-riffs on the movies of Alfred Hitchcock and Richard Linklater. To his characters, a church and a bank by Eero Saarinen (Eliel Saarinen’s son) are everything and nothing.
Jin (John Cho), an English-to-Korean book translator in Seoul, travels to Columbus after his father, an architecture historian, collapses while in town for a talk. As Jin waits to find out whether his semi-estranged father will ever regain consciousness, he strikes up a friendship with Casey (Haley Lu Richardson), a tour guide and lifelong Columbus resident. A year out of high school, she is tempted to leave to study architecture, but she fears for the well-being of her unpredictable blue-collar mother (Michelle Forbes), for whom she cooks and essentially looks after.
Over several days, as Casey and Jin wander the sites, they debate such heady ideas as the healing power of buildings, modernism’s relationship to religion, and why — or whether — architecture means something to them. (“You grow up around something and it feels like nothing,” Jin says.) Kogonada also introduces parallel not-quite love interests: for Casey, a librarian (Rory Culkin) whose disquisition on the relative interest of video games and books may be intended as advice on how to watch this film; for Jin, a colleague of his father’s (Parker Posey) on whom he had a crush as a teenager.
The acknowledged influence of the great Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu looms over the proceedings. Kogonada draws not only on Ozu’s frequent theme of generational conflict but also on his shooting style. (Like Ozu, he often “crosses the line,” violating the conventions of how the camera is positioned relative to the characters in a scene.) The found backgrounds are as suggestive as the dialogue, with the director often observing his actors through doorways and mirrors.
“Columbus” can be slyly mysterious from a structural standpoint, both with respect to the plot’s elisions and several cuts that demand that viewers fill in the blanks.

The subject is the environment in Crossett, Ark., the site of a Georgia-Pacific paper mill. It is also, according to the interviewees in the film, a place where pollution has harmed the health of the populace.

We hear from a chemist and environmental science experts who have nothing good to say about their findings in Crossett, and while watching a movie is probably a poor way to assess air and water quality, what we see of the waterways, land and smoke-filled sky certainly looks damning.

Kevin Tent, Alexander Payne’s longtime editor, has worked on some of that director’s funniest movies, including “Sideways” and the forthcoming “Downsizing.” Yet Mr. Tent’s directorial debut, “Crash Pad,” indicates this artist has more to learn about his new craft.
“Crash Pad” follows a millennial slacker and self-professed romantic, Stensland (Domhnall Gleeson), in the depths of heartbreak after the end of his fling with a married woman, Morgan (Christina Applegate). After binge-watching episodes of “Dawson’s Creek” and trying to blackmail his former flame, Stensland receives an unusual proposal from Morgan’s husband, Grady (Thomas Haden Church from “Sideways”). The two men become roommates in a bid to make Morgan jealous while they mend their bruised feelings with women and cheap tequila.
The movie’s premise isn’t as bad as the forced, unnatural dialogue. Even the reliable Ms. Applegate and Mr. Church can’t salvage the screenwriter Jeremy Catalino’s clumsy lines. “Morgan’s faithlessness has emboldened me to take a vacation,” Grady declares when moving into Stensland’s apartment. Saddled with the wordiest scenes in the movie, Mr. Gleeson comes across like a college freshman fumbling through his first Shakespeare play.
Stensland and Grady’s romantic plight might have earned more sympathy if their characters weren’t so insufferable. While Mr. Tent’s direction is serviceable, it’s safe. His movie lacks any stylish risks that would make this trio’s bad romance memorable, leaving “Crash Pad” to feel like a warm-up act." 0.037758505 "Comedy" "R" "Vertical Entertainment" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" NA

This intermittently diverting movie is adapted from a 1949 Agatha Christie novel, and it’s several degrees more engaging than another recent Christie-based movie, “Murder on the Orient Express.” But it’s still slight.
Max Irons plays the young private eye Charles Hayward, who gets a visit in his dingy office from the beautiful Sophia (Stefanie Martini), an old love whose grandfather, an unpopular tycoon, has shuffled off this mortal coil under unusual circumstances. After consulting with the vinegary Scotland Yard hand Chief Inspector Taverner (Terence Stamp, always welcome), Charles sets out to the estate, filled with aunts, sons, in-laws and others, embodied by an all-star cast including Glenn Close, Julian Sands, Gillian Anderson and Christina Hendricks.

A jury convicted two young men of the murder, one of whom, Colin Warner, had nothing to do with it. Nonetheless, Mr. Warner spent more than 20 years in prison until, thanks in large part to the tireless efforts of his friend Carl King (known as CK), his conviction was overturned and he was released.
This story inspired a gripping, enraging episode of “This American Life,” and “Crown Heights,” written and directed by Matt Ruskin, tries to adhere both to the factual record and a careful, detail-focused documentary ethos. Like its protagonist, sensitively and shrewdly played by Lakeith Stanfield, the film is soft-spoken and thoughtful, with sweet, lyrical touches that alleviate some of the grimness without blunting the cruelty and injustice of what happened.
On the day of the murder, as Colin and CK (Nnamdi Asomugha) go about their routines, “Crown Heights” quietly registers the texture of New York life in 1980. The crime and violence that were much more prevalent then than now, but also the daily rituals of love, family and work that never really change. Colin steals a car (for the chop shop where he works), flirts with a neighbor, Antoinette (Natalie Paul), and runs an errand for his grandmother. Then all of a sudden he’s in custody, and ensnared in a bureaucratic and penal nightmare. Months stretch into years, and while CK raises money, hires lawyers and pursues appeals, Colin, incarcerated at the New York state penitentiary in Dannemora, fights to stay sane, safe and hopeful.
Our attention shifts back and forth between the two men, which provides narrative momentum at the cost of dramatic and psychological depth. CK’s devotion to the cause of his friend’s exoneration strains his marriage, and the long sequence of stalls and setbacks in court and in parole hearings erodes Colin’s morale. These developments are conveyed in scenes that feel a bit too pointed and familiar — effective in the moment but not quite as powerful as they might have been.
But “Crown Heights” nonetheless makes a powerful argument that Colin’s imprisonment was hardly an anomaly. Mr. Ruskin cuts in news clips of several generations of politicians from both parties — including Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton and former New York Gov. George E. Pataki — making tough-on-crime speeches promising longer sentences, more executions and less parole. In the meantime, the kinds of policies they promote take their toll on Colin.
Like countless other black men, he is ensnared in a system that seems rigged against him in every way. The police, the prosecutors, the prison guards and some of his own lawyers cut corners, rush to judgment and ignore the clear evidence of his innocence. You get the sense that they are part of a vast, shadowy, brutal machine, the illumination of which feels urgently necessary even as it lies outside the film’s scope.
But the choice to focus on Colin rather than on his persecutors is an honorable and ethical one, and “Crown Heights” is a moving tribute to his resilience and the steadfastness of the people who love him." 0.952822131 "Drama" "R" "IFC" "" "$30,173 " "$238,558 " "" "1" "24-Oct-01" "" "9" 1.3

The original concerned the rivalry between Dusty (Mark Wahlberg), a globe-trotting macho man of mystery, and Brad (Will Ferrell), the teary, trying-too-hard stepfather married to Dusty’s ex-wife, Sara (Linda Cardellini), and helping to raise Dusty’s children. At the start of “Daddy’s Home 2,” the now-buddies have figured out a way to share parenting duties.
When their own fathers arrive for Christmas, several barely disguised gags from the first movie repeat. Don (John Lithgow) proves as cringingly lovey-dovey as his son, Brad; Kurt (Mel Gibson), Dusty’s father, is a crass repository of growls, backslaps and chauvinist remarks. Kurt’s only trait that doesn’t scream “Gibson” is that he is supposed to be a former astronaut.
To punch up the families’ winter holiday, Kurt books an impromptu getaway on Airbnb. You might think the late reservation is the setup for a joke, but no, it’s just product placement.

Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister best known (then and still) for his policy of appeasing Hitler, was replaced by Winston Churchill, whose first weeks as head of the government — culminating in the Dunkirk evacuation — are the subject of “Darkest Hour,” Joe Wright’s new film. (The evacuation itself was reconstructed in Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk,” released in July.)
Considered as history, “Darkest Hour,” written by Anthony McCarten (“The Theory of Everything”), offers the public a few new insights and details about the practice of statecraft in a time of crisis. Churchill is disliked by many of his colleagues in the Conservative Party (notably Chamberlain and his vulpine sidekick, Viscount Halifax) and distrusted by King George VI. The political situation is shaky, the military reports dire. The new prime minister, a man of large emotions and larger appetites, who drinks whiskey with breakfast and is rarely without a cigar, is plagued by frustration and doubt as he tries to navigate between two bad options. Will Britain enter into a ruinous war or submit to humiliating and most likely temporary peace on terms dictated by Hitler?
The contours of this story are reasonably familiar. The outcome even more so. (Just in case, a helpful text before the final credits reminds us that Germany eventually lost the war.) Churchill himself is among the most revered and studied figures of 20th-century history: a synonym for leadership; a great man in an age of monsters; a source of pithy quotations, some of which he actually said; an example to be cited by political mediocrities in need of an ego boost.
And, of course, an irresistible role for actors of every shape and size. (His American counterpart in this regard is not Franklin D. Roosevelt, Churchill’s partner and peer, but Lyndon B. Johnson, who also possessed impressive jowls and a colorful way with words.) Gary Oldman, aided by diligent makeup artists and propelled by his own unmatched craft and discipline, embraces the task with almost palpable delight. The challenges facing Churchill are of lethal seriousness, but the key to his effectiveness is his capacity for pleasure. He enjoys the push and pull of politics, the intellectual labor of problem-solving and the daily adventure of being himself. In grasping that joy, Mr. Oldman partakes of it and passes it along to the audience. He is having fun, playing the part in every sense. And his blustery, blubbery charm, backed as it is by a sly and acute intelligence, is hard to resist.
Apart from Halifax and Chamberlain, desiccated aristo puddings played by Stephen Dillane and Ronald Pickup, nobody makes much of an effort. Churchill is regarded with frank adoration by the camera and by the people, the women in particular, charged with the tasks of attending and indulging him. Kristin Scott Thomas is his wife, Clementine Churchill, a woman of brisk confidence and ironic disposition who long ago made peace with her secondary place in his public life. Lily James is his secretary, Elizabeth Layton, a clever and wide-eyed English rose who types Churchill’s correspondence and chastely buoys his morale at difficult moments.
King George is played by Ben Mendelsohn as a weary and aloof sovereign — a chillier, sadder fellow than the version incarnated by Colin Firth in “The King’s Speech.” “Darkest Hour,” a companion to “Dunkirk,” is also in several senses a sequel to “The King’s Speech,” a mildly enjoyed best picture winner. It is similarly a movie about the production of an important piece of rhetoric, a “mobilization of the English language” in the service of a vital and righteous cause.
And like “The King’s Speech,” Mr. Wright’s film is a serviceable enough historical drama. But like “Dunkirk,” it falls back on an idealized notion of the English character that feels, in present circumstances, less nostalgic than downright reactionary, and as empty as those ubiquitous “Keep Calm and Carry On” internet memes. Rather than invite the audience to think about the difficulties of democratic governance at a time of peril, the filmmakers promote passivity and hero-worship, offering not so much a Great Man Theory as a great man fetish. Their sham populism is most evident in a ridiculous scene in which Churchill rides the London Underground and meets The People, a motley mass of stiff upper lips and brimming eyes.
Churchill’s resolve, like the bravery of the soldiers, airmen and ordinary Britons in “Dunkirk,” is offered not as a rebuke to the current generation, but rather as a sop, an easy and complacent fantasy of Imperial gumption and national unity. Standing up to the Nazis, an undeniably brave and good thing to have done, is treated like a moral check that can be cashed in perpetuity. “Darkest Hour” is proud of its hero, proud of itself and proud to have come down on the right side of history nearly 80 years after the fact. It wants you to share that pride, and to claim a share of it. But we have nothing to be proud of." 0.996478906 "Biography" "PG-13" "Focus Features" "" "" "" "" "37" "1-Feb-91" "" "" NA

But behind the facade of a self-assured showman is the secret Mr. Turner tries to keep to himself: He’s blind.
Mr. Turner, 63, had rebelled in his youth against the grim prognosis that he would one day lose his eyesight. From his love of TV westerns, he learned the sleights of hand used by cardsharps. Then with an obsessive — and sometimes reckless — energy, he made a career as one of the foremost card magicians in his field, performing at the Magic Castle nightclub in Hollywood, at magic conventions and on TV talk shows.
As confident as he appears when shuffling a deck of cards, Mr. Turner remains at odds with his blindness. In a few TV appearances, awkward moments arise when the host clumsily refers to Mr. Turner’s disability before he can illustrate his strength as an illusionist. In candid interviews, he’s open about his discomfort around strangers showering him with sympathy and his attempts to hide his blindness in public by refusing to use a cane or a guide dog.
Mr. Korem keeps a reverent distance from his subject, as if not to spoil the magic. The director is either too polite or too timid to push Mr. Turner to reveal more details than he’s comfortable sharing.

Mr. Martin plays the title character, an illustrator who has been at sea personally and professionally since his mother’s death. Kevin Kline is Robert, Dean’s father, who also feels the loss but is reconciled to moving on. Among the ways he plans to do so is to sell the house where he still lives and where Dean grew up, a decision Dean is not ready to accept.
The two don’t fight over this so much as use it as an excuse to avoid each other, in a lighthearted sort of way — the movie is more comedy than drama. Dean goes from the East Coast to the West on a supposed business trip, and dithers around out there with his friend Eric (Rory Scovel).
Mr. Martin, taking a lesson from Woody Allen, gives his character lots of amusing opportunities to skewer pretentiousness. Like practically every comic who has written himself a movie script, he also gives his character a gorgeous woman (Gillian Jacobs) to fall into bed with, which leaves the movie less insightful than it might be.
For both Dean and his father, the cure for grief seems to be female companionship. (Mary Steenburgen plays Robert’s potential partner.) That might be a way to rebound from romantic heartbreak; the death of a loved one is a very different matter.

A psycho-in-the-woods tale whose villain is more funny-looking than alarming, this debut effort from the director Sam Patton is notable mainly for the beautifully organic performances of its two female leads. In tandem with Matt Anderson and Michael Larson-Kangas’s surprisingly sensitive script, the women create a believably intimate bond between their beleaguered characters.
Both are unsettled from the outset. Abby (Jaimi Paige), recently widowed, is struggling to reconcile her grief with that of her 13-year-old son, Sam (Toby Nichols). At the same time, her longtime friend Jen (Alyshia Ochse) is surveying the emotional gaps in her own life and mulling a major decision. All three have hiked into the wilderness to scatter the deceased’s ashes on his favorite mountain; behind them, a hooded stranger (Claude Duhamel) silently follows.
For a long time, this mystery stalker does little but lurk, periodically releasing spooky blasts of vintage music — presumably to get his hack-’em-up mojo going. Though with neither dialogue nor obvious motivation, he’s less a character than an abstract mechanism to force an emotional catharsis: a trigger for mother and son to reboot and reconnect.
This repeated tilt toward tenderness slackens the tension, and, as Andi Obarski’s camera sweeps swiftly past the nasty bits, we sense that neither she nor her director is gung-ho for gore.

Gru and Lucy enlist Gru’s long-lost brother, Dru (also Mr. Carell), to assist in Bratt’s capture. Dru, who lives in a seemingly Mediterranean paradise called Freedonia (you heard that right, but the Marx Brothers references end there), is obscenely wealthy and has an indefinable blondish hairdo apparently trendy among the obscenely wealthy.

"80" "Detroit" "8/4/2017" "7/26/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/movies/detroit-review.html" 0 "Racial slurs fly fast and furious in Kathryn Bigelow’s “Detroit,” but the most troubling and divisive words uttered onscreen are variations on the simple pronouns “they” and “them.” The words may be perfectly neutral in themselves, but when used to separate one group of people from another they take on an insidious, implicitly violent connotation.
“Detroit” is set mainly during the rioting that convulsed that city in the summer of 1967, and in it “them” is most often used — along with cognates like “those people” and “you people” — by white soldiers and police officers to refer to African-American citizens. (Nearly every white character with a speaking role wears a uniform of some kind.) Occasionally things go in the other direction, with “they” referring to the white authorities, but the reversal doesn’t indicate any kind of symmetry.
The movie, which paints a sometimes muddled picture of a chaotic and contested moment in history, is admirably clear in this regard. It understands and strives to dramatize racism not as a matter of bad personal attitudes or equal and opposite prejudices, but rather as a structuring fact of American life, an apparatus of power, exclusion and control wielded against “them.”
Ms. Bigelow and Mark Boal, the screenwriter (who collaborated with her on “The Hurt Locker” and “Zero Dark Thirty”), train their focus on two aspects of the Detroit story: the day-to-day texture of working-class black life and the operations of white supremacy in conditions of emergency. Balancing those concerns is no easy task, and the filmmakers don’t take an easy route through their material. “Detroit,” like its namesake city, is populous and contradictory, with dozens of significant characters competing for attention as richly detailed scenes swell in crescendos of desperate suspense and sickening brutality.
At moments (the quietest as well as some of the most intense), you feel in tune with both the fine grain of experience and the larger sweep of history. The specific, close-up acts of cruelty you witness are comprehensible as manifestations of a systemic, continuing and frequently invisible pattern of injustice. The film’s struggle against simplification — against the sentimentality, wishful thinking and outright denial that defines most Hollywood considerations of America’s racial past — is palpable, almost heroic, even if it is not always successful.
Early scenes — following a gorgeous animated prologue that uses Jacob Lawrence paintings to evoke the decades of job discrimination, residential segregation and heavy-handed law enforcement that preceded the 1967 riots in Detroit and other Northern cities — zero in on the rebellion’s immediate cause: a late-night police raid on an unlicensed saloon.
The opening 20 minutes register Ms. Bigelow’s virtuosity as a choreographer of chaos. She illuminates volatile and unpredictable circumstances with amazing poise and precision, producing an intuitive understanding of events that quickly spiral beyond the control or comprehension of their participants. Her combination of efficiency and expressiveness is matched by the actors — a formidable, mostly youthful ensemble including John Boyega, Will Poulter, Algee Smith and Jason Mitchell — even though the script at times inhibits their range, locking them into simple stances of aggression and fear.
Amid the fire and looting and the audio and video clips of the Michigan governor George W. Romney and President Lyndon B. Johnson, a narrower plot takes shape, a real-life horror movie folded into a baggier film that feels, by turns, like a combat picture, a cavalry western, a police procedural and a courtroom drama.
The fates of a collection of black and white Detroiters (as well as two unlucky visitors from Ohio) converge at a motel on the west side of the city. Two friends, Fred (Jacob Latimore) and Larry (Mr. Smith), are looking for a little fun after a disappointing evening at the Fox Theater downtown. They flirt with Karen (Kaitlyn Dever) and Julie (Hannah Murray), two white women, and join a makeshift party in a room belonging to Carl Cooper (Mr. Mitchell).
Down the hall is Greene (Anthony Mackie), a soldier just back from Vietnam. A few blocks away, Melvin Dismukes (Mr. Boyega), a black security guard protecting a grocery store, brings coffee to a group of National Guardsmen, a gesture of diplomacy as well as self-protection. “I don’t want those boys shooting at us,” he tells his co-worker. Meanwhile, three patrolmen cruise the city. One of them, Krauss (Mr. Poulter), is still on the job after fatally shooting an unarmed looting suspect in the back.
The nightmare that brought them all together is remembered as the Algiers Motel incident. It’s a notably ugly chapter in the annals of late-60s urban violence, and one that has an especially grim resonance in our own time. Three black men were shot to death — nine other people were terrorized and beaten — after the police and guardsmen arrived at the motel, responding to reports of sniper fire.
Real events depicted in movies can’t exactly be given away, and this episode, while not as notorious as some other race-related murders of its era, isn’t all that obscure. (It is the subject of a book by John Hersey, a writer for The New Yorker, published a year after the riots and reissued in 1997 with an informative introduction by the historian Thomas J. Sugrue.) The basic arc of the story — the killing of unarmed black men, the spasm of outrage, the impunity ultimately bestowed on the perpetrators — is always shocking and rarely surprising. I’m sorry if that’s a spoiler.
What matters more to Ms. Bigelow and Mr. Boal than plot twists or surprises — and to an audience torn between the urge to lean in and the desire to look away — is the minute-by-minute unspooling of accident, error and intentional evil that produced a tragic result. The important thing is not the literal accuracy of the overall account (though Mr. Boal, a former journalist, has been diligent in his research) but its plausibility. Is this what could have happened? Does it feel true?
The answers, of course, can hardly be objective. The language of cinematic action — which Ms. Bigelow speaks as fluently and inventively as any living American director — is an idiom of feeling and visceral response. There are parts of “Detroit” that have a raw, unsettled authenticity, and others that sink in a welter of screaming and cursing.
The Algiers becomes a trap, not only for the characters, who are stuck inside at the mercy of a maniac, but for the film itself, which loses its political and psychological coherence as the night drags on. Krauss, with his disconcertingly boyish looks and his sophomoric attempts to seem thoughtful, is a callow sociopath. His fellow officers Flynn (Ben O’Toole) and Demens (Jack Reynor) contribute sexual hysteria (when they see white women in the company of black men) and sheer idiocy. They are terrifying and contemptible — dismayingly believable figures from the prehistory of what is now called the alt-right.
But as their villainy comes into relief, the humanity of their hostages begins to blur. In a horror movie, the monster is inevitably the center of interest, and once the first body in the motel falls, “Detroit” begins to trade its vivid sense of nuance — especially present in its delicate observation of Fred and Larry’s friendship — for bluntness and sensationalism. A complex, dreadful piece of history becomes an undialectical ordeal of viciousness and victimhood.
The film opens with the assertion that in Detroit and elsewhere in the mid-1960s, “change had to come” and “the question was when and how.” But the promise implied in that “how” is one that “Detroit,” for all its impressive craft and unimpeachable intention, proves unable to fulfill. It is curious that a movie set against a backdrop of black resistance and rebellion — however inchoate and self-destructive its expression may have been — should become a tale of black helplessness and passivity. The white men, the decent ones as much as the brutes, have the answers, the power, the agency.
The filmmakers seem aware of this problem. They try toward the end to give the movie back, in effect, to its African-American characters, to refuse to let racism have the final word and to free themselves of storytelling conventions that insist on comfort and consensus. It doesn’t quite work. American movies have a hard time with division and with real-world problems that have yet to be solved. American politics does, too.

Unfortunately, the fresh blood has been saddled with a tired story, the family road trip that goes outlandishly awry, and the result is another forgettable film.
The title character, Greg (Jason Drucker); his older brother, Rodrick (Charlie Wright); and their toddler sibling, Manny (Wyatt and Dylan Walters), are dragged by their parents (Alicia Silverstone and Tom Everett Scott) on a lengthy trip to visit the family matriarch for her 90th birthday. The two older boys conspire on a plan to take a detour to a video game conference, where Greg hopes to repair damage done by a viral video that made him infamous.
The bits familiar from every other family trip comedy turn up with numbing predictability: the wretched hotel, the overheated minivan, the stops at tawdry roadside attractions, the vomit scene. All of the principal cast members are new, but the director, David Bowers, isn’t; he did installments No. 2 and 3 as well as this one, the fourth, and his preference for “hey, look at me” acting from the child stars is again on full display. Bathroom humor, none of it funny, abounds.
It’s all based on the characters created by Jeff Kinney (who wrote this script with Mr. Bowers), which remain much more tolerable as stick figures, the way he renders them in his books, than they do in the flesh." 0.096803828 "Comedy" "PG" "Fox" "$22,000,000 " "$7,126,084 " "$20,738,724 " "" "1,229" "5-Aug-94" "" "" NA

The new film “Dina,” which advertises itself as a “real-life romantic comedy,” is an unusually penetrating example of this type of picture. Made by the directing team of Dan Sickles and Antonio Santini, it gets very close to a couple, Dina Buno and Scott Levin, as they plan their wedding.
The movie opens with Dina, voluble and vulnerable, asking a dental assistant to take her hand before a dentist drills into a bothersome tooth. The viewer soon learns that Dina is autistic, as is Scott (he refers to himself as “an Aspy”). Her symptoms are, in fact, milder than Scott’s, but a past that scarred her both physically and emotionally compounds problems.
They are a sweet couple whom you want to root for, and their conditions and circumstances have imbued them with personalities that some might perceive as quirky. Recalling his proposal to Dina, Scott enthuses to friends, “Red Robin, what a romantic place to get hitched.”
Documentaries like this maintain their spell only if they keep the viewer from wondering, “What the hell is the camera doing here?” I lasted until a scene from their honeymoon, in which Dina fills up a champagne-glass shaped bathtub; Scott, who has trouble even conceiving of physical intimacy, is seemingly oblivious to the implications of this action.
As it happens, there are some reasonable, if not entirely satisfactory, answers to the question, but the viewer won’t learn them during the movie itself. (Mr. Sickles has known Dina his whole life; his father was one of her teachers.)

"83" "Downsizing" "12/22/2017" "12/21/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/movies/downsizing-review-matt-damon-kristen-wiig.html" 0 "One of my favorite movies of 2017, “War for the Planet of the Apes,” posited near-total human extinction as a more-or-less happy ending. A radically dystopian future seems like the best we deserve these days, and it was impressive to see a summer blockbuster offer such harsh medicine.
Alexander Payne’s new movie, “Downsizing,” doesn’t go nearly as far. Surveying a landscape of impending ecological catastrophe, it proposes a future that is only mildly dystopian and prescribes laughter rather than apocalyptic despair as, if not exactly a remedy, then at least an acceptable palliative. We don’t need to disappear altogether, but it might be better all around if we weren’t so darn big.
Mr. Payne’s title refers not to corporate cost-saving strategies but to a technological procedure invented by scientists in Norway and adapted for universal, commercial use. People are efficiently and almost painlessly shrunk to around four or five inches. This is sold as an environmental panacea: Our tiny selves will take less of a toll on the earth’s resources and produce less waste. The burden we impose on our hot, crowded planet is expected to decrease proportionally.
But Mr. Payne is a canny student of modern American culture and in particular of the ways his fellow citizens conflate selfishness and virtue. The real attraction in becoming small isn’t that you consume less; it’s that you can have a whole lot more. That’s what Paul and Audrey Safranek, an Omaha couple played by Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig, discover. Compared with their regular-size lives of compromised dreams and diminished expectations, downsizing promises luxury and abundance. Once they liquidate their modest assets, they can move into a mansion in a planned community called Leisureland and pursue a guilt-free vision of material happiness. The hard sell is provided, at a surreal seminar, by Neil Patrick Harris and Laura Dern. What could go wrong?
Mr. Payne, who wrote “Downsizing” with his frequent collaborator Jim Taylor, zooms in on the fine print in the contract — in other words, on the ways our ingrained fallibility upends our utopian projects. Paul, having undergone the irreversible (and hilariously detailed) reduction, finds himself unexpectedly alone in Leisureland. The world of “the small” — who are somehow both an oppressed minority and a privileged elite — is afflicted by the usual problems. Selfishness and deceit haven’t disappeared, and bigger injustices still exist. Paul sees a news report about a political dissident involuntarily made tiny by an oppressive government and later discovers festering inequality around Leisureland itself. Some of the familiar contradictions of 21st-century capitalism are magnified as Paul, a Gulliver gone native in Lilliput, eventually discovers.
Mr. Damon’s regular-guy affability carries the movie through its expository phase, which is a lot of fun. Mr. Payne has an admirably concrete logistical sense and an eye for amusing incongruities. The transition from big to small is full of clever touches, like the spatulas that lift the newly shrunken out of their suddenly oversize beds, as if they were freshly baked one-bite cookies.
Paul, big and small, is just interesting enough to be good company. He is friendly, but with that hint of heartland hostility that is layered into every Alexander Payne hero’s temperament like a smear of hot mustard in a bologna-and-cheese sandwich. Paul’s passivity gives the movie a leisurely rhythm unusual in both science fiction and satire, the two genres that “Downsizing” nods toward without fully embracing.
Instead, the movie resembles an episode of “The Twilight Zone” directed by Preston Sturges. An outlandish, pointedly allegorical conceit is inhabited not by symbolic figures but by terrestrial oddballs. You don’t see this at first, because Mr. Payne is so charmed by the conceit itself. Like a video gamer uninterested in winning and in no hurry to advance to higher levels, he knocks around the corners and side streets of his invented reality, treating it the way he treated Hawaii in “The Descendants,” wine country in “Sideways” and his beloved Nebraska in most of his other movies — as a picturesque, lived-in backdrop for the spectacle of human ridiculousness.
About an hour in, “Downsizing” amps up that ridiculousness in risky and wonderful fashion. Just when we (along with Paul) assume we’ve figured out the rules and boundaries of this place, Christoph Waltz shows up as Paul’s upstairs neighbor, an international man of mystery named Dusan. Shortly thereafter, Paul meets Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau), a Vietnamese dissident who becomes the agent of his ethical and romantic reawakening. For a delirious while, fueled by Mr. Waltz and Ms. Chau’s zigzagging comic energies, we are transported to a land beyond genre, a zone of pure comic sublimity.
And then, with a bit of a thud, this kinetic and good-natured movie discovers its limitations and shrinks before our eyes. Mr. Payne and Mr. Taylor, roaming freely in their conjoined imaginations, wander off into the bushes and then stumble into the middle of the road. Paul’s journey loses direction and momentum, and sour, nagging questions begin to intrude. Haven’t we seen this story before, in which a white man’s anomie is cured by the love of an exotic woman? Did we come all this way to rediscover the ouroboros of guilty liberal self-consciousness?
Well, yes, as it turns out. But then again the whole point of the movie is the scaling down of expectations to arrive at something like an accurate sense of scale, and disappointment may be a perverse sign of success. “Downsizing” is an ambitious movie about the value of modesty, and its faults are proportionate to its insights. I sort of wish it felt like a bigger deal, but maybe that’s my problem." 0.874170316 "Comedy" "R" "Paramount" "$68,000,000 " "$4,954,287 " "$24,449,754 " "" "700" "26-Sep-86" "" "" NA

Those films examined the moral struggles of military personnel as they conduct missions with clinical precision while far removed from danger. “Drone” sticks to the home front, following Neil Wistin (Sean Bean), a drone pilot on assignments for a covert C.I.A. contractor in Washington State, and Imir Shaw (Patrick Sabongui), a visitor to his home with an ulterior motive.
Neil, an alcoholic who hides his actual job from the members of his family, is as removed from them as he is from the citizens in Pakistan he inadvertently kills with a missile controlled from his office. His wife, Ellen (Mary McCormack, solid), is having an affair. His sensitive son, Shane (Maxwell Haynes), bonded with Neil’s father as the old man was dying, while Neil can’t even compose a eulogy. When Imir stops by Neil’s house and offers to buy a boat he has inherited, Neil, touched by his gentle earnestness, invites him over for supper, only to learn that Imir knows Neil’s work history — and lost his wife and daughter in one of Neil’s aerial assaults.
The movie opens with a bravura sequence set in Pakistan, and the script, by Mr. Bourque and Paul A.

"85" "Dunkirk" "7/21/2017" "7/20/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/movies/dunkirk-review-christopher-nolan.html" 1 "One of the most indelible images in “Dunkirk,” Christopher Nolan’s brilliant new film, is of a British plane in flames. The movie recounts an early, harrowing campaign in World War II that took place months after Germany invaded Poland and weeks after Hitler’s forces started rolling into the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and France. The plane, having glided to a stop, has been defiantly set ablaze by the pilot to avoid its being captured. It’s an image of unambiguous defeat but also an emblem of resistance and a portent of the ghastly conflagrations still to come.
It’s a characteristically complex and condensed vision of war in a movie that is insistently humanizing despite its monumentality, a balance that is as much a political choice as an aesthetic one. And “Dunkirk” is big — in subject, reach, emotion and image. Mr. Nolan shot and mostly finished it on large-format film (unusual in our digital era), which allows details to emerge in great scale. Overhead shots of soldiers scattered across a beach convey an unnerving isolation — as if these were the last souls on earth, terminally alone, deserted. (Seen on a television, they would look like ants.) Film also enriches the texture of the image; it draws you to it, which is crucial given the minimalist dialogue.
The movie is based on a campaign that began in late May 1940 in the French port city of Dunkirk, where some 400,000 Allied soldiers — including more than 200,000 members of the British Expeditionary Force, the British army in Western Europe — were penned in by the Germans. The British, faced with the capture or possible annihilation of their troops, initiated a seemingly impossible rescue. Named Operation Dynamo, this mission has assumed near-mythic status in British history and been revisited in books and onscreen; it shows up in “Mrs. Miniver,” a 1942 Hollywood weepie about British pain and perseverance in the war meant to encourage American support for the Allies.
War movies tend to play out along familiar lines, including lump-in-the throat home-front tales like “Mrs. Miniver.” “Dunkirk” takes place in battle, but it, too, is a story of suffering and survival. Mr. Nolan largely avoids the bigger historical picture (among other things, the reason these men are fighting is a given) as well as the strategizing on the front and in London, where the new prime minister, Winston Churchill, was facing the horrifying possibility of diminished military muscle. Churchill is heard from, in a fashion, but never seen. Mr. Nolan instead narrows in on a handful of men who are scrambling and white-knuckling their way into history on the sea, in the air and on the ground.
By turns intimate and sweeping, the film opens with six soldiers walking away from the camera down a spookily deserted street. Their bodies are shown in full, head to toe, and they are flanked by low buildings, the sort that now look so charming in touristic photographs. Slips of paper swirl around the men like autumn leaves. A few grab at the papers. One tries slurping water from a nearby garden hose; another pokes a hand through an open window, searching for a smoke. Still another reads one of the papers, which shows a map of the surrounding area encircled by arrows and ominous words of warning in English. He then crumples it, unbuckles his belt and begins to squat.
It’s a somewhat perplexing, awkwardly funny moment — this is a manifestly serious situation, and you’re about to watch a man defecate. You don’t know whether to laugh, but before you decide, shots ring out and the soldiers start running, the camera quickly following. The haunted emptiness is suddenly filled with the sounds of frantic escape and whizzing bullets. And then the men begin falling, one, two, three, until just the unbuckling one remains, scrambling first over a gate and soon onto a beach where thousands of other soldiers are massed and waiting. He silently takes in the extraordinary scene and then hustles over to a dune to begin undoing his belt again.
Scarcely a word has been uttered up to this point, yet much has been expressed: isolation; danger; desperation; fear; relief; and sheer, extreme bodily need and effort. Throughout this de facto prologue, Mr. Nolan emphasizes the concrete details, making you acutely aware of the fine-grained textures — the sores and embedded dirt on a man’s hands — and every resonant sound: the dribbling of water, the fluttering of paper, and the sharp crack and mechanical buzzing of rifle fire that turns into muffled thuds when bullets enter bodies. By the time the surviving soldier reaches the beach, you are already closely acquainted with his heavy breathing, wild fumbling and clumsy, chaotic running.
Soon, the scene switches to another port, where a British teenager, George (Barry Keoghan), is helping a father and son (Mark Rylance and Tom Glynn-Carney) unload a small yacht that’s been requisitioned for the Dunkirk mission. The three men instead set sail on their own, joining a civilian fleet — a rousing, motley armada of tugs, steamers, ferries and so on — that’s racing across the Channel. A third, astounding narrative section soon opens in the air, where three British Spitfire planes are quickly engaged in battle against German planes headed for Dunkirk, racing through the vast canopy and bobbing under clouds as the sun flashes, temporarily blinding them.
Mr. Nolan’s elastic approach to narrative works beautifully in “Dunkirk,” which oscillates among its three sections, each largely taking place in distinct locations in different time frames. The events on the beach — called the Mole for the breakwater that’s used as a dock — unfold during one week. The events on the sea occur in one day, while the air scenes transpire in an hour. The locations and the time periods are announced onscreen. At first the dividing lines aren’t always obvious as Mr. Nolan cuts from daytime scenes on the ground to those in the sea and in the air, a slight merging of space and especially of time that underlines the enormity of a fight seemingly without end.
Once Mr. Nolan begins switching between day and night, the lines dividing the three narrative segments mostly sharpen. Even as each section — with its individual dramas and perils — comes closer into view, Mr. Nolan keeps them all in dynamic play with one another. Some of this he achieves with stark visual echoes, as when water rushing into a downed Spitfire engulfs the pilot and elsewhere a soldier nearly drowns. (Tom Hardy plays the most critically important pilot, while a sympathetic Jack Lowden takes on a critical support role.) At one point, Mr. Nolan pulls the three narrative strands tightly together, creating a tremendous, enveloping sense of bone-deep dread.
“Dunkirk” is a World War II movie, one told through soldiers, their lived and near-death experiences and their bodies under siege. Names are generally irrelevant here; on the beach — and in the sea and air — what counts are rank, unit, skill and the operation, although more important is survival, making it through another attack and somehow avoiding exploding bombs. Mr. Nolan’s emphasis on the visceral reality of Dunkirk leaves much unsaid; even in some opening explanatory text, the enemy isn’t identified as Nazi Germany. The soldiers, of course, know exactly who they are fighting and perhaps even why, but in the field the enemy is finally the unnamed stranger trying to kill them.
The soldier who scrambles over the gate and onto the beach is called Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) in the credits, but I don’t remember hearing or reading his name. Mostly, I just thought of him as Our Boy, less because of his youth than because of the vulnerability communicated through Mr. Whitehead’s slight figure and tangible physical performance, his small and large gestures and moves: the darting, panicked eyes; the nervous, abrupt gestures; the hunched shoulders. In time, Tommy is joined by other soldiers waiting and running and ducking on the beach, the most important played by the equally fine Aneurin Barnard and the singer Harry Styles.
Mr. Nolan’s unyielding emphasis on the soldiers — and on war as it is experienced rather than on how it is strategized — blurs history even as it brings the present and its wars startlingly into view. “Dunkirk” is a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday’s fights and today’s. Mr. Nolan closes that distance cinematically with visual sweep and emotional intimacy, with images of warfare and huddled, frightened survivors that together with Hans Zimmer’s score reverberate through your body. By the time that plane is burning — and a young man is looking searchingly into the future — you are reminded that the fight against fascism continues." 0.999074015 "Action" "PG-13" "Warner Bros."

Even so, her career dips to a new low with “Eloise,” a horror movie of such ineptitude that it invites sympathy for even its least gifted participants.
Speaking of whom, we have the ever-expressionless Chace Crawford, who plays the lead, Jacob, like a lobotomized inmate of the former mental hospital of the title. To claim an inheritance, Jacob breaks into the long-shuttered institution, seeking the death certificate of a relative who stands between him and the cash. Accompanying him are a shifty pal (Brandon T. Jackson), a hot barmaid (Ms. Dushku) and her mentally unstable brother, Scott (P. J. Byrne), an amateur historian who’s obsessed with this particular loony bin.
Filmed in the real Eloise, a gargantuan, 900-acre complex in Michigan that closed in the early 1980s, the movie traffics in the usual haunted-hospital clichés: the sadistic doctor (Robert Patrick) and his grisly therapies; the linebacker orderlies; the corridors crammed with the lame and the halt. While Jacob and the barmaid unearth a shared family history — and Scott charges around like a dog in a bacon factory — the director, Robert Legato, gives us no sense of their relative locations. Instead, we follow flashing torches through pitch-black rooms and wait for this motley crew of idiots to be picked off.
A strange mix of the recycled and the surreal, “Eloise” flatlines long before its most hilariously bizarre scene: a ghostly patient-staff party with swing music, jitterbugging nurses and drive-by abominations.

In addition to directing midnight-movie classics like “El Topo” and “The Holy Mountain,” he has composed music and written many books. He is an expert on the tarot and psychotherapy. But in his two recent autobiographical films — “The Dance of Reality” and now “Endless Poetry” — Mr. Jodorowsky, at 88, shows the irrepressible energy of a man who is just getting started.
The main character in “Endless Poetry” is exactly that: a 20-ish Alejandro (played by the director’s son Adan) discovering his literary vocation in Chile in the late 1940s. Burning with ambition and existential hunger, Alejandro makes his way through bohemian Santiago, collecting friends, lovers, mentors and muses among the city’s artists and writers. Some of their names — Nicanor Parra, Stella Díaz Varín and Enrique Lihn — can be found in the annals of 20th-century Chilean literature. Along with Pablo Larraín’s “Neruda,” this film would be a useful assignment in an introductory course on the subject.
Not that there is anything remotely dry or academic about Mr. Jodorowsky’s approach to the story of his own life. “I’m going to save Surrealism,” his younger self declares, and “Endless Poetry” makes good on that vow with a barrage of improbable situations and bizarre, sometimes grotesque images. The most surreal effect may be the casting. Mr. Jodorowsky in his present gray-bearded state shows up to narrate, and in addition to Adan, another son, Brontis, appears onscreen, reprising the role of Alejandro’s bullying, insecure father, which he played in “The Dance of Reality.”
That film was infused with the wonders and terrors of childhood, and was a tour de force of Freudian mischief and Felliniesque nostalgia. “Endless Poetry,” telling a more diffuse story, doesn’t reach quite the same level of intensity, but it is testament to the relentless energy and undimmed ingenuity of its creator and a moving defense of the prerogatives of the imagination.
Realism is not on the agenda, but Mr. Jodorowsky nonetheless evokes the chaotic, passionate spirit of a time and offers astute insights into his own psychology. He uses masquerade, puppetry, theatrical lighting and set design and the luridly expressive cinematography of the great Christopher Doyle to create a world of hallucinatory artifice. Alejandro’s mother, Sara, who sings all her dialogue in fluting operatic tones, is played by Pamela Flores, who also plays Stella, the young poet’s beer-drinking, cigar-smoking protector and sort-of lover. This doubling is mirrored by the resemblance between Adan Jodorowsky and Leandro Taub, who plays Alejandro’s pal and sort-of rival Enrique Lihn.
For all of these characters, poetry is fundamentally a sensual undertaking, and Mr. Jodorowsky is a voracious poet of the flesh. It’s too easy to describe his interest in unusually large and small bodies, in wounded and painted skin, in amputation and contortion as perverse, freakish or provocative. That language belongs to the patriarchal world of propriety and repression, against which Alejandro’s life is one long protest. The images in “Endless Poetry” are arresting and sometimes disturbing, but there is an earnest commitment to ecstasy and authenticity that renders moot any question of offensiveness or exploitation.
Coherence may also be beside the point. “Endless Poetry” is never boring, but it has a tendency to meander and repeat itself. Mr. Jodorowsky is a poet in the broadest sense, a restless artist whose temperament isn’t wedded to any particular form. He seems to embrace cinema out of convenience. He can’t beam his visions directly into your brain, or tattoo his words on your body, but this is the next best thing." 0.985832627 "Biography" "Unrated" "Abkco Films" "" "$9,811 " "$9,811 " "$50,974 " "2" "22-Oct-10" "28-Oct-10" "7" 1

So to say that “Everybody Loves Somebody” is predictable is no real criticism, as being able to foresee the ending — almost from the beginning — is exactly what most viewers expect.
Our messed-up heroine is Clara (Karla Souza, clearly delighted to escape the constraints of her lugubrious character on “How to Get Away With Murder”), an OB-GYN by day and a drunken karaoke singer by night. Fumbling hookups with random men temporarily banish her loneliness without extinguishing her torch for Daniel (José María Yazpik), the lover who abandoned her eight years earlier.

And guess whose clothing soon evaporates in the heat of Daniel’s twinkling attention?
Toggling between Los Angeles and Mexico, English and Spanish, this sophomore feature by Catalina Aguilar Mastretta asks Clara to choose between naughty and nice. The setup is commonplace, but the scenery is delicious, the dialogue refreshingly tart and the keen supporting cast frisky or affecting, as the occasion demands.
Indeed, the movie’s most authentically romantic moment occurs not between Clara and her suitors, but between her sister and brother-in-law (Tiaré Scanda and K. C.

"91" "Ferdinand" "12/15/2017" "12/14/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/movies/ferdinand-review.html" 0 "The classic picture book “The Story of Ferdinand,” written by Munro Leaf and illustrated in inky black-and-white by Robert Lawson, tells the tale of a bull who would rather smell flowers than fight, even when he finds himself in the ring in Madrid. Published in 1936 with the Spanish Civil War on the horizon, the book, interpreted as pacifist propaganda, found enemies on both sides.
“Ferdinand,” the new computer-animated adaptation from Carlos Saldanha (the “Ice Age” movies), speaks to its own time in a different way, dutifully adhering to the template for contemporary children’s films while avoiding much personality or distinction. The be-yourself messaging is easy to comprehend. A growing-up montage is set to an original Nick Jonas song that sounds like ideal music to get put on hold to. The farm animals represent a cross-section of nations, from a Scottish Highland bull (voiced by David Tennant) to German horses. And the movie is bright and peppy enough to hold young viewers’ attention, though a faithful 1938 Walt Disney short showed more inventiveness in eight minutes.
The expanded adventures of Ferdinand (John Cena as an adult) find him encountering new friends, including a misfit goat (Kate McKinnon, whose freewheeling comedy style doesn’t register in the cartoon format) and three hedgehogs (Gina Rodriguez, Daveed Diggs and Gabriel Iglesias). He buries the hatchet with the bulls who bullied him as a child. For some reason, Peyton Manning lends his voice to the one who always has an upset stomach.
Unlike in the book, Ferdinand earns the arena’s cheers for not fighting, but the crowd’s sense of surprise will elude audiences attending “Ferdinand.”" 0.860156238 "Animation" "PG" "Fox" "$111,000,000 " "$13,401,586 " "" "" "1,582" "1-Apr-88" "" "" NA

The likes of Madonna and the photographer Helmut Newton had primed that pump long ago, turning dominance, submission and toys into an acceptable spectacle. But it apparently took a writer as terrible as E L James, the author of the “Fifty Shades” series, to really hit the commercial sweet spot. The result is a clutch of best sellers, a hit movie (based on the first book, “Fifty Shades of Grey”) and now a sequel, “Fifty Shades Darker,” that’s almost bad enough to recommend.
Well, not quite, though it’s always instructive to watch how many different ways one movie can go wrong and to guess what happened between a first feature and a second. For all its flaws, “Fifty Shades of Grey” had a competent director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, who mostly wrung a watchable movie out of the material, partly by letting lightness and laughter in. It also had a natural star in Dakota Johnson, one of those unforced charmers who can deliver bad lines so gracefully that, after a while, you don’t much care about their quality. With low-key charisma, she drew you toward her, so that your attention and hopes fell on her instead of the nonsense surrounding her. She was a stealth weapon.
I was still rooting for Ms. Johnson in “Fifty Shades Darker,” even if it proved tough going. Once again, the story involves the on-and-off, tie-her-up, tie-her-down romance between Anastasia Steele (Ms. Johnson) and her billionaire boyfriend, Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), a guy with sculptured muscles, expensive playthings and dreary issues. Stuff and kink happens: A gun is fired, a would-be rapist is punished and Anastasia is bound hand and foot. Mostly, she advances and retreats (repeat), mewls and moans, and registers surprise each time Christian tries to dominate her outside the bedroom, evincing the kind of stalkerlike behavior that usually leads to restraining orders.
Given how Ms. James and Ms. Taylor-Johnson are said to have clashed over the making of the first movie, it is easy to guess who the dominant player was in “Fifty Shades Darker,” and it probably wasn’t the new director, James Foley. He’s a professional with real credits, so I assume that he’s not finally responsible for the ineptitude of “Fifty Shades Darker,” which ranges from continuity issues to unsurprisingly risible writing. There are also abrupt swings in tone, dead-end detours and flatline performances, including from Ms. Johnson. The sex is strained and certainly seems to burn serious calories (Christian flips Anastasia like a pancake), but finally pales next to the commodity fetishism. The use of Ben and Jerry’s vanilla ice cream, however, made for great product placement.
There’s not much else to say except that the all-media screening of “Fifty Shades Darker” I attended had scarcely begun before it turned into a live edition of the TV show “Mystery Science Theater 3000.” At least some of the few hundred moviegoers seem to have arrived with modest expectations; others had seen “Fifty Shades of Grey,” so presumably knew better. Soon, though, the individual scattered titters and excited murmurings began to shift and to harmonize as skeptics and true believers alike became as one, joined by the display of so much awfulness.

In 1982, a band of Guatemalan soldiers entered the tiny village of Dos Erres, looking for anti-government guerrillas. They found none, and soon began raping and murdering the residents. More than 200 bodies, some still alive, were thrown into a well and buried.
Two boys were abducted and then reared by soldiers’ families. One boy, Oscar Ramírez, was 3 and grew to believe that the people raising him were his real family. Years later investigators began a search for Oscar — as an adult, he’d moved to the United States — deeming him to be “living evidence” of the mass killing. If he were located, a DNA sample could be obtained; that would match bodies at the site, and strengthen a case against the soldiers accused of the murders.
Finding him, though, would create a problem. “How do you tell someone, ‘You’re not who you think you are, and your life up until now has been a lie’?” one interviewee says.
The film, directed by Ryan Suffern, at times plays out like a thriller as witnesses come forward and skeletons are exhumed. Mr. Suffern’s pacing is energized but respectful, and his script, written with Mark Monroe, smartly summarizes events of the time.
Despite recounting brutality, “Finding Oscar” manages to generate some hope as human-rights workers, prosecutors and forensic scientists seek justice for victims of these war crimes.

I was in a pretty foul mood when I went to see “Fist Fight.” It was Wednesday. It was February. It was 2017. And while I can’t exactly say that the movie cheered me up, it did give me something I needed. Not catharsis or uplift but a bracing dose of profane, sloppy, reasonably well-directed hostility. We take what we can get.
The movie, directed by Richie Keen from a script by Van Robichaux and Evan Susser, breaks no new ground. It’s a bad-teacher comedy about a school staffed with stock figures played by reliable performers. There’s a grouchy principal (Dean Norris), a horny guidance counselor (Jillian Bell), a dweeby security guard (Kumail Nanjiani), a nutty football coach (Tracy Morgan) and a femme fatale French instructor (Christina Hendricks). They provide a Greek chorus of goofiness behind the main conflict, which is between Mr. Campbell (Charlie Day), an anxious English teacher, and his profoundly irritable colleague, Mr. Strickland (Ice Cube), whose subject is history.
Ice Cube brings his own history to the project, at one point quoting a famously inflammatory N.W.A lyric and glancing back to the days when, as one of my colleagues put it, “everyone was scared” of him. Campbell certainly is, especially after a series of misunderstandings leads Strickland to challenge him to the after-school face-off that gives the movie its name.
A bit of context: It’s the last day of school, and the seniors are pulling pranks — involving a horse, paintball guns and a lot of penis graffiti — at the Atlanta high school where the two adversaries work. This provides an extra dollop of slapstick chaos, but the kids are peripheral to the movie’s main interest, which is in the mismatch and implicit bromance between Ice Cube and Mr. Day. Each one does what he’s expected to do. Mr. Day twitches and babbles and blinks his eyes rapidly. Ice Cube bellows and glowers and doesn’t blink at all.
There is an obvious racial dimension to their conflict, though “Fist Fight” tiptoes around it, winking and whispering, with typical big-studio timidity. (The most recent season of the HBO comedy “Vice Principals” came closer to touching the hot core of resentment in a Southern public school setting.) And it is certainly possible to interpret this movie as yet another fable of a white man’s redemption at the hands (or fists, as the case may be) of a black man. We know that Campbell has a young daughter (Alexa Nisenson) and a pregnant wife (JoAnna Garcia Swisher). We learn nothing at all about Strickland, except that he is the subject of wild legends among the student body. His job in the movie is to teach Campbell some hard lessons about being a man.
All of which is fairly tiresome. But it’s also possible to read “Fist Fight” against the interracial buddy-movie grain, seeing Strickland rather than Campbell as the protagonist, and taking Strickland’s anger as a principled response to circumstances rather than as evidence of a mood disorder. The big fight takes place against a background of layoffs and budget cuts. The teachers are harassed by the students and undermined by the administration, yet they persist in the work of education. Strickland is an agent not of guilty racial fear but of righteous class consciousness. The lesson he imparts to Campbell is one of public-sector workers’ solidarity. By all evidence, he’s a pretty good teacher, with good reason to stay mad. Which cheered me up, I must say." 0.800154686 "Comedy" "R" "Warner Bros.

It’s startling in its simplicity. The well-known 1990 movie being remade here is something other than beloved, or classic. Rather it is remembered as a widely-derided post-Brat Pack ensemble piece. (And while the movie was indeed largely derided, The New York Times gave it a positive review, as did the critic Roger Ebert.) The potential for accusations of sacrilege is minimal.
The original “Flatliners,” directed by Joel Schumacher from a script by Peter Filardi, teamed the newly minted Julia Roberts with the lesser-known peers Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt and Billy Baldwin in an underbaked story of medical students in the grip of a literally morbid obsession. Intent on exploring life after death, they temporarily put themselves into the uncharted territory of brain death (hence the title), with what were supposedly scary side effects relating to the wreckages of their past. Mr. Schumacher’s movie is more a failed tone poem than a horror picture, and to its credit, this new version, with a trickier script by Ben Ripley and hyper-competent direction from the Swedish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev improves on it — by making it behave like a horror movie every now and then.
Still. As much as I try not to outsmart the movies I watch, when this one opened with a color-desaturated scene of Ellen Page driving a car with a young girl in the passenger seat, the devil on my shoulder said, “There is going to be a terrible accident, the girl is going to die, and this will spur the Ellen Page character into exploring the afterlife.”
I was right. This set the tone for much of the rest of my viewing.
Mr. Sutherland shows up here, but he doesn’t reprise his irresponsible character from the first movie; he is a supervisor to the five medical students having after-death adventures, each one a particular type (There’s James Norton’s playboy, Nina Dobrev’s alpha, Kiersey Clemons’s striver and Diego Luna’s Diego Luna), saddled with guilt that haunts them despite their near-death experiences also turning them into super-geniuses.
This film did not screen for critics, nor was it previewed in New York theaters on a Thursday night, as is usually customary with studio pictures. I imagine Columbia understood that it had something arguably worse than a dog on its hands.

G.M.O.s — genetically modified organisms — and the crops they enable have become another field of battle.
Directed by Scott Hamilton Kennedy, “Food Evolution” hopes to demystify G.M.O.s and points to successes like Hawaiian papayas and Ugandan bananas, which were saved from devastating viruses. And while it gives opponents their say, the film rebuts their arguments, including reports that suggest G.M.O.s lead to a rise in farmers’ suicide rates and an increase in pesticide use. (The response to the first: correlation is not causation; to the second, yes, but those pesticides are far less toxic.)
The film also speaks with food journalists (including Michael Pollan, a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine) as well as farmers who have benefited from the technology. And if trust is an issue, Neil deGrasse Tyson, perhaps the most credible public scientist on the planet, is its narrator.
The documentary acknowledges the gorilla in the garden: Monsanto, a leading exponent of modification, is “one of the most-hated companies in the world.” There are many reasons Monsanto raises hackles, Dr. Tyson acknowledges, but “to be concerned about the safety of their G.M.O.s is to be misinformed.”
The food industry recruits scientists to speak on its behalf, but in press notes and email correspondence, the film’s producers say no funding came from any Big Ag company or lobbying group. “Food Evolution” was commissioned by the nonprofit Institute of Food Technologists, and the filmmakers retained creative control.
With a soft tone, respectful to opponents but insistent on the data, “Food Evolution” posits an inconvenient truth for organic boosters to swallow: In a world desperate for safe, sustainable food, G.M.O.s may well be a force for good." 0.473254708 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Abramorama" "" "$4,161 " "$53,953 " "$23,105,471 " "2,995" "12-Sep-08" "20-Nov-08" "70" 10

Rather, this feather-light French confection, written and directed by Paul Calori and Kostia Testut, addresses its dignity-of-work thesis with sweetness and heart.
The songs are unmemorable and the choreography less than twinkle-toed, but the lyrics are a delight.
“Part-time jobs ain’t fine,” trills Julie (Pauline Étienne), the determined young striver at the movie’s squishy-soft center. “Filling in forms, standing in line.” Echoing the plight of millions of young Europeans, Julie longs for permanent work, so when she lands a probationary position in the stockroom of a luxury shoe factory, the eruption of a labor dispute threatens to undermine her plans.
A cri de coeur against outsourcing and downsizing, “Footnotes” bossa novas its way through myriad themes without leaving a dent in any of them. Feminism (the shoe stitchers are all women), French craftsmanship and lack of respect for middle management are all lyricized, while empty design studios underscore the precariousness of couture itself.

Levine and Landon Van Soest, grew out of a People magazine article from 2011 about the Innovative Concept Academy, an alternative school in St. Louis designed to rehabilitate teenagers who might otherwise be incarcerated. The film follows one such student over about two years.
The movie begins with Daje Shelton, known as Boonie, then 17, visiting a courtroom after a school fight. The judge, Jimmie M. Edwards, who opened the academy, tells her that he will decide whether to lock her up. The alternative school is her last option for getting a high school diploma, he says. She won’t be able to attend other public schools in Missouri.
“For Ahkeem” trails Boonie as she tries to graduate. It’s not clear that she will pass the necessary coursework. Her apparent apathy toward school seems, in part, like the product of a bleak upbringing filled with poverty and street violence. She casually rattles off the names of dead friends (“too many to count”). Boonie also has a boyfriend, which leads to complications that shouldn’t be spoiled.
The filming period coincided with the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, and a grand jury’s decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the officer who shot him.

The documentary “Frank Serpico” fills out an American classic that is now almost 45 years old. “Serpico,” the 1973 movie directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Al Pacino, was an adaptation of a book by Peter Maas about a New York City police officer who fought corruption in the ranks and got, among other things, a bullet in the head for his trouble. The real-life subject is now 81 years old, whippet-thin, and a storyteller and self-examiner of no small gifts.
Whenever Mr. Serpico appears in this admiring film, directed by Antonino D’Ambrosio, the movie lights up. “I told myself I was an actor,” he says into a mirror onscreen, describing how he would work himself up before hitting the streets to make arrests. He recalls, speaking from the restaurant in Brooklyn that used to be his father’s shoe-repair store, how even in childhood his admiration for police work was mitigated by experience. Once, he says, a uniformed officer came into the place, got a shoeshine from Frank, who was then a child, and left without paying. Next time, Frank’s father demanded payment upfront. “The cop never came into the store again,” Mr. Serpico says. “Although he had the shield of the law, he demeaned it by his actions.”
Mr. Serpico joined the force in 1959 and, witnessing casual payoffs that were accepted without a thought, encountered further disappointment: “The job was not on the level.”
The star of the movie is a compelling figure, and Mr. D’Ambrosio presents quite a few people from Mr. Serpico’s past who have a similar draw. But the director’s filmmaking instincts are not always salutary. He introduces each new interviewee with a shot of the subject standing, looking into the camera for several seconds. This affectation grows wearying. The actor John Turturro is not an uninteresting subject, but watching him talk about his reaction to the Lumet-Pacino movie, you get the feeling he is only there because Mr. D’Ambrosio could not secure an on-camera interview with Mr. Pacino.
The movie does feature a sit-down between Mr. Serpico and Arthur Cesare, his partner in the narcotics division, who was present the night Mr. Serpico was shot. He tells Mr. Cesare that he considers it peculiar that no 10-13, or “officer in need of assistance,” call went out on his behalf. But there’s no combustion in the confrontation, and the exchange goes limp. Could Mr. Cesare have called it in, and if so, why didn’t he?

“Free Fire,” directed by Ben Wheatley from a script he wrote with Amy Jump, applies a more-is-more ethos to the formula: The ingredients here include a best actress Academy Award winner, Brie Larson; dozens of firearms; and a slew of male characters of varying levels of smugness and idiocy to help out with the shooting. The film is a formal exercise in spectacle under constraint: An extended standoff in a contained space surprisingly full of hazards.
The story is set in the era of eight-track tapes and ultrawide lapels. Cillian Murphy plays an Irish gun buyer with a cause; Armie Hammer, Sharlto Copley and Babou Ceesay are among the idiosyncratic sleazebags doing the selling. The deal is going down in a grungy abandoned warehouse in Boston, with Ms. Larson’s character, Justine, acting as broker. Before things can conclude amicably, an unpleasant coincidence-among-lowlifes sets the gangs against each other. All hell breaks loose, ebbs, breaks loose again, and so on.
Mr. Wheatley’s “High-Rise” was a highlight of 2016, and again he shows that he’s a technically virtuosic director whose humor has a bracingly nasty side. He’s also no dummy. “Free Fire” is an action movie finely tuned to even the most potentially vicious audiences’ tolerances. It is filled with mayhem, but avoids grisly violence — at least until the finale pulls out some gory, and not inapt, punch lines.
Luxuriating in disreputability in all the right ways, the film also contains no shortage of profane verbal wit: From an impeccably delivered “Ugh, men,” from Ms. Larson, to a one-bit gunman’s complaint about hating a certain type of “freelance job” that he describes with an expletive." 0.372240737 "Action" "R" "A24" "" "$994,431 " "$1,799,312 " "" "9" "20-Jan-93" "" "" NA

It’s one thing to read about roundups of suspected illegal immigrants; it’s quite another to observe the anxiety of smart, talented teenagers trying to keep their cool while under the watchful gaze of immigration officials and the police.
In his director’s statement, Mr. Newton declares that he didn’t set out to make a political film. But recent government actions lend a painful urgency to these interwoven stories. With the fear of deportation hanging over their heads, these adolescents are forced to weigh major life decisions at an age when their American-born peers are fretting about the already stressful challenges of dating and getting into college.
“From Nowhere” focuses on three promising students whose caring teacher Jackie (Julianne Nicholson) has arranged for them to meet with an immigration lawyer (Denis O’Hare) who is working pro bono to help them achieve political asylum before they graduate. To bolster their cases, he asks them to supply detailed evidence of the horrors they fled. Asylum is more likely to be granted if their histories involved genocide, genital mutilation or a dictatorship.
The most promising student is Moussa (J. Mallory McCree), whose frightened mother (Chinasa Ogbuagu) brought the family from Guinea to the United States to live with a man who subsequently abandoned them. Now the family is behind in the rent and facing eviction.
Bitter, cynical Sophie (Octavia Chavez-Richmond) is from the Dominican Republic and lives with an uncle who treats her as a household slave in an extended family where he resents her presence (another mouth to feed). Because his beer-drinking buddies make surreptitious passes at her when they come over to watch sports, she trusts no one, and her rage threatens to boil over. Her defensive hauteur leads her fellow students to think she is crazy.
The bright, peppy, Peruvian-born Alyssa (Raquel Castro), the class valedictorian, has the most difficulty compiling evidence for the lawyer, and is also the least developed character.
The tensions among these boisterous teenagers are palpable in scenes of their being stopped on the street at night by the police and interrogated, and at a post-prom party that threatens to erupt into a brawl. Even among the faculty members, the atmosphere is so tense that Jackie is taken aside by a superior and questioned about her possibly inappropriate relationship with Moussa.
“From Nowhere” culminates in a celebratory graduation ceremony. But by this time excruciating choices have been made, and the uncertain future of a student who chooses to leave the country gives the film an underlying sadness. Their ordeal feels cruel, unnecessary and infuriatingly real.
“How could I think I had anything to teach these kids about reality?” a disheartened Jackie muses in a final conversation with the lawyer, during which she learns which student has the best chance of receiving asylum. “They could teach me about reality.”" 0.911551828 "Drama" "Not Yet Rated" "FilmRise" "" "$7,384 " "$61,782 " "$62,750,000 " "2,899" "22-Jun-01" "" "133" 19

Few viewers are likely to make it that far, so let’s start where many will stop: the English-language title, whose meaning is never clarified.
Instead of a land of the moon, Nicole Garcia’s mostly turgid, occasionally risible period piece, largely set in the 1950s, initially takes us to Lyon, France. Gabrielle (Marion Cotillard) spots a familiar address on a building that prompts flashbacks to a lost love.
In her youth, she chases after a teacher with an almost feral abandon, privately licking his copy of “Wuthering Heights.” It’s not clear whether she’s mad, as some think, or whether her longings result from a repressive upbringing. The movie barely seems to decide.
Gabrielle’s mother (Brigitte Roüan) arranges for her to marry a Catalan laborer (Alex Brendemühl), who is bizarrely nonchalant about the deal. (At Gabrielle’s request, he agrees never to have sex with her.)
But when Gabrielle receives a diagnosis of kidney stones — the subtitles translate the French term “mal de pierres” as “stones sickness” — she travels to the Alps. There, the film offers “A Cure for Wellness” unexpected competition for the most ludicrous 2017 release set in a Swiss spa.

Jake’s is to fix the space-based weather-control system he designed and built, racing against a digital clock that counts down the minutes until “geostorm.” Mine involves counting the minutes until “Geostorm” is over and then offering a comprehensive damage assessment. To quote something Jake says to a grandstanding senator (Richard Schiff) who dares to question his expertise: you’re welcome.
Directed by Dean Devlin from a script he wrote with Paul Guyot and discreetly installed in theaters without advance screenings, “Geostorm” uses digital technology to lay waste to a bunch of cities and hacky screenwriting to assault the dignity of several fine actors. Andy Garcia and Ed Harris are the president and secretary of state, while Abbie Cornish is a Secret Service agent secretly keeping company with a deputy secretary named Max Lawson (Jim Sturgess) who happens to be Jake’s younger brother. The siblings have their differences, but they share an unplaceable American accent, an aversion to regular shaving and a desire not to see the world destroyed by ice, fire, hail or heavy rain.
The movie does what it can to replicate those elemental forces. I happened to see it in the 4DX format — a first for me — which combines the thrill of a Mad Tea Party ride with the sensory challenges of a cab ride across the Manhattan Bridge on a rainy night. Your seat rocks and rumbles during chase scenes, lists gently from side to side during zero-gravity interludes and abuses your lumbar spine when space junk starts flying. You sometimes catch a whiff of burning skyscraper, a spray of monsoon mist, a whoosh of gale-force wind and the gentle caress of Mr. Butler’s stubble on your cheek.
Not that last thing, actually, but I’m sure they’re working on it. And I look forward to future 4DX adventures, or at least to installing one of those chairs in my office. I wouldn’t say the experience improved “Geostorm,” but it certainly didn’t make it any worse. As for Mr. Butler, he is no more or less credible as a renegade scientific genius than in any other role he’s attempted; consistency is his chief and perhaps his only virtue as an actor.

"104" "Get Out" "2/24/2017" "2/23/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/movies/get-out-review-jordan-peele.html" 1 "In “Get Out,” an exhilaratingly smart and scary freakout about a black man in a white nightmare, the laughs come easily and then go in for the kill. The writer and director, Jordan Peele (of the comedy sketch show “Key & Peele”), knows how to make shadowy streets into menacing ones and turn silences into warnings from the abyss. His greatest stroke in “Get Out,” though, is to have hitched these genre elements to an evil that isn’t obscured by a hockey mask, but instead throws open its arms with a warm smile while enthusiastically (and strangely) expressing its love for President Obama.
Those arms and smiles all but engulf Chris (the British actor Daniel Kaluuya, going deep in a breakthrough performance), a photographer with a sweet pad, adorable dog and equally frisky, adoring girlfriend, Rose (a perfectly cast Allison Williams, from the HBO show “Girls”). The story opens with them preparing for a long weekend with her parents. “Do they know I’m black?” Chris gently asks. They don’t, but Rose assures him not to worry, and off they go into the countryside and narrative complications. Mr. Peele, making his feature debut, sets a cozy, innocuous scene complete with coos and loving glances, a tranquillity that shatters with an eerily inopportune deer crossing.
By the time Chris and Rose pull up to her parents’ house — a stately brick building with imposing white columns and rocking chairs on the front porch — ripples of unease have disturbed the calm. The nicer Rose’s parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener), behave, the greater the ripples. They don’t blink at him or his race (Ms. Keener is a virtuoso of the deadeye stare), but instead adopt the forced geniality of people who seem anxious to hide their discomfort. Missy’s the watchful one, while the voluble Dean cozies up to Chris, dropping embarrassing slang and relating an odd story about Jesse Owens, the black Olympian who shocked Hitler.
Mr. Peele is best known for his work with Keegan-Michael Key on their titular comedy sketch show, where politics mixed freely with the laughs. Together they starred in the 2016 comedy “Keanu,” a lampoon of action cinema that was a (slack) piece with the movie love that was a mainstay of their show. In one memorable bit from the show, heckling cinephiles voice their complaints (“this movie has an inconsistent visual language!”); in another, two friends realize that the reason the zombie hordes aren’t attacking them is they’re flesh-eating racists. “Get Out” expands on, and considerably deepens, a similar idea by turning white racism into disquieting genre shivers.
But Mr. Peele is after more than giggles and shocks; he’s taking on 21st-century white racism and its rationales. The opener — a black man talking on a cellphone on an empty suburban street — briskly sets the tone, unsettles the mood and announces Mr. Peele’s way with metaphor. He’s working within a recognizable horror-film framework here (the darkness, the stillness), so it’s not surprising when a car abruptly pulls up and begins tailing the man. You may even snicker because you think you’ve seen this flick before. Except that when this man anxiously looks for a way out, the scene grows discordantly disturbing because you may, as I did, flash on Trayvon Martin.
It’s a jarring moment that might have been catastrophic for the movie if Mr. Peele didn’t quickly yank you back into its fiction. (He’s got great timing, no surprise.) There’s relief when the offscreen world recedes just then. Yet part of what makes “Get Out” both exciting and genuinely unsettling is how real life keeps asserting itself, scene after scene. Our monsters, Mr. Peele reminds us, are at times as familiar as the neighborhood watch; one person’s fiction, after all, is another’s true-life horror story. ” For his part, Chris, separated existentially, chromatically and every other way, spends so much time putting the white world at ease that he can’t recognize the threat coming for him.
Mr. Peele knows that threat, plays with it and eviscerates it with jokes and scares, only to top it off messily with full-on Grand Guignol splatter. But some of his finest, most genuinely shocking work is his quietest. One of the best scenes I’ve seen in a long while finds Chris talking with one of the parents’ black servants, a maid, Georgina (a fantastic Betty Gabriel). Chris confesses that he gets nervous when around a lot of white people, an admission that Georgina answers by advancing toward him with a volley of “no, no, no,” cascades of tears and a smile so wide it looks as if it could split her face in two. Something has gotten under her skin and it’s frightening." 0.998633531 "Comedy" "R" "Universal" "$4,500,000 " "$33,377,060 " "$176,040,665 " "" "1,201" "27-Sep-91" "" "" NA
"105" "Ghost in the Shell" "3/31/2017" "3/30/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/movies/ghost-in-the-shell-review-scarlett-johansson.html" 0 "Like the greatest screen goddesses, Scarlett Johansson rises above it all. In the thrill-free science-fiction thriller “Ghost in the Shell,” her character comes at you in pieces, emerging first during the opening credits in the form of a metallic skeleton. It’s a good look — it evokes the original Terminator — but soon the skeleton is being dipped like a chip in whitish goo. This technological soup gives the metallic frame a humanoid cladding, making it more reassuringly and pleasantly familiar, from bosomy top to round bottom. It looks like a giant dream Barbie, hairless pubis and all.
Enjoy these credits because they offer some of the more arresting, inventive images in this visually cluttered yet often disappointingly drab movie. A live-action version of a famed Japanese manga by Shirow Masamune, “Ghost in the Shell” is one of those future-shock stories that edges around the dystopian without going full-bore apocalyptic. To that end it is set in a possible future world that looks distant enough to seem exotic and familiar enough to seem plausible. The original manga takes place in what’s described as a “strange corporate conglomerate-state called ‘Japan,’” while this movie unwinds nowhere in particular, just a universal megalopolis filled with soaring gray towers.
Anyone who has seen Ridley Scott’s “Blade Runner” or that film’s innumerable 2.0 follow-ups (“Strange Days,” “The Fifth Element”) will recognize this “Ghost” cityscape, with its jumbled forms, neo-noir shadows, patina of art-directed decay and its conspicuous Asian-Hollywood fusion touches. Some of this tickles the eye, like the semi-translucent, pony-size koi fish that float through the air, seemingly just because they look cool. The koi don’t seem to be selling anything other than the movie’s production values and visual concept; elsewhere, enormous spectral human figures loom over buildings like embodied billboards, nicely evoking rampaging movie monsters of the past.
The most important leviathan, of course, is Ms. Johansson, whose mysterioso cyborg, Major, effortlessly slides right into this scene, with her preternaturally still face – often as blank as a mask – and the ports in the back of her neck that she uses to jack into cables and other characters. These artificial orifices are pleasingly mysterious and highly suggestive, at once creating a sense of human vulnerability and raising the possibility of the posthuman. Major occasionally stuffs goo in her ports and also uses them to plug into others. About the only part of her that’s human is her soul, or “ghost” in the story’s poetic parlance. The rest of Major is a bendable, mendable shell, which makes her well suited for hard-core tactical work with a police outfit known as Section 9.
As the title suggests, “Ghost in the Shell” is haunted, including by the original manga, its sequels and several excellent animated movies: the first, also titled “Ghost in the Shell,” and the entrancingly lovely “Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence,” both directed by Mamoru Oshii. The new “Ghost in the Shell” was directed by Rupert Sanders, who has made commercials and one other feature, “Snow White and the Huntsman.” He likes a dark palette and is good with actors, but there’s little here that feels personal, and he mostly functions as a blockbuster traffic cop, managing all the busily moving, conspicuously pricey parts.
That’s too bad, especially because the original “Ghost in the Shell” is such a delightful philosophical plaything, with pleasures that simultaneously bewitch the eye and enchant the mind. This version, by contrast, ditches the original’s big, human, all-too-human questions, but keeps all the firing guns and car chases, the action clichés and intentional genre stereotypes. Stripped of its deeper-dish musings, the story turns into a perfectly watchable, somewhat bland action movie, tricked out with sharp details, some fine actors and one slumming legend, the director-actor Takeshi Kitano, who plays Aramaki, Major’s boss. He only speaks in Japanese; Major and almost everyone else speak in English.
The characters understand one another, presumably because they’re beyond mere language and, in any event, they sometimes communicate telepathically. At first, the fact that they can speak to one another comes across as an inventive flourish, but like so much in “Ghost in the Shell” — the toddling geishas, the Asian extras — it helps to reduce an entire culture to a decorative detail. The movie has been widely criticized for casting Ms. Johansson in a role that was, of course, originally Japanese, a decision that isn’t offset by an absurd narrative twist that seems to have been created to forestall criticism but will only provoke further ire.

The gifted child here is a 7-year-old math prodigy, Mary (Mckenna Grace, charmingly precocious), who is being raised by her uncle Frank (an impressive Chris Evans). He wants a normal life for Mary; her mother, also a math genius, was under pressure and committed suicide when Mary was a baby. So they live a simple life with their one-eyed cat in Florida, where Frank fixes boat engines; the grime under his nails (and the beer he swigs) suggest that he’s firmly rooted in the working class.
Yet Frank and Mary’s strong bond — one of the film’s most convincing parts — is tested when he sends her off to the first grade. She’s been home-schooled, but Frank thinks it’s time she tried “being a kid.” While Mary can solve differential equations, she has less-than-advanced social skills and manners. Her teacher (Jenny Slate) recognizes her abilities immediately, and floats the idea that Mary would be better served at a prep school. Frank objects, but it’s too late: Soon Frank’s rich mother (a haughty Lindsay Duncan) arrives from Boston to usher Mary off to a life of higher learning. Next stop: the local court, where a fight for her “best interest” ensues, bogging down the story.
Octavia Spencer also pops up in this otherwise fleet-footed film, but the supporting role — if you can call it that — is paltry. She’s brilliant in her few scenes, yet hardly plays as full-fledged a character as she did in another film about mathematicians, “Hidden Figures.” If only there were a court for this injustice." 0.68094886 "Drama" "PG-13" "Fox Searchlight" "$7,000,000 " "" "$24,801,212 " "" "187" "19-Feb-82" "" "" NA

Now 94, Rose Marie, who proudly asserts that she went by her first name before any other celebrity, started singing for crowds at the age of 3, pairing an adorable child’s face with the brassy belt of a grizzled diva. That distinctive voice would later become a terrific vehicle for punch lines. After gaining fame onstage, where she sang a duet with Evelyn Nesbit (the chorus girl whose husband killed the architect Stanford White, setting off a media circus), she moved to radio, film and most notably television. There she co-starred as a wisecracking comedy writer on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” and later for many years on “Hollywood Squares.” In between the successes of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett, Rose Marie, this movie argues, was one of the most important female comic voices in America.
Carl Reiner and Mr. Van Dyke provide colorful personal testimony about working with her — and Dan Harmon, the creator of “Community,” displays an insightful critic’s eye — but the heart of this movie is Rose Marie talking you through her own life with the same attention to pleasing the audience as she shows onstage. Her steely good cheer is good company as she relates taut, action-packed stories about run-ins with Al Capone and Jimmy Durante with a minimum of introspection.
Jason Wise’s documentary, which relies on re-enactments and backstage footage with sparing use of performances, is a love letter to the performer but not the business, in which she managed to achieve a measure of fame for nine decades, while still being overlooked. Her single-minded focus on work is presented as admirable but also something of a curse. As in the documentary “Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,” this is a movie about a star never at peace unless she’s performing, a contrast with “Gilbert,” another compelling, surprisingly moving documentary about an eccentric with an old-school work ethic.
The stand-up comic Gilbert Gottfried has built a highly respected career telling profane, even shocking jokes in a sandpaper voice. The director Neil Berkeley nicely sketches his career with an emphasis on controversial comedy. (“I have a flight to California,” he said at a roast weeks after Sept. 11. “I can’t get a direct flight. They said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first.”)
What distinguishes this documentary is the incongruity between the raucousness of the humor and the quiet, mundane rituals of his domestic life, whether puttering around his New York apartment or in more joyous scenes with his two children and wife, Dara Gottfried.
As an unlikely love story, this movie excels, presenting a relationship so affectionate and warm that it overwhelms the jokes. When he curses at his wife, she takes it as a sweet nothing. And when she cracks a joke, he’s quick with a booming laugh. “Gilbert” is that rarest of things, a portrait of a happy comic." 0.991446268 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Submarine Deluxe" "" "$2,957 " "$514,354 " "$554,341,323 " "4,324" "4-May-07" "19-Aug-07" "112" 16

In the 1930s, runaway brides ran amok with banter and high jinks; in the 1940s, femmes fatales did their men wrong with lipstick sneers and a bullet to the heart. The latest iteration of this type of movie often skews comic and generally involves a group of gal pals getting together for some “we time.” They find trouble and, here’s hoping, their bliss amid oceans of booze and maybe drugs, sometimes in the company of men, who are alternately helpful or hapless.
The affably amusing, sometimes spittingly funny comedy “Girls Trip” recycles much of the same naughty women idea used and occasionally abused in movies like “Bad Moms” and “Sisters.” As in the recent “Rough Night,” the women in “Girls Trip” are old college friends who, after going down their respective paths, are reuniting for better and, at times, for worse. In “Rough Night,” the regulation naughtiness ends up with the women, who are mostly white, accidentally (uh-oh) killing a man. That isn’t on the menu for the black women in “Girls Trip,” who, despite being fictional also exist in our world and so presumably would have a much harder time giggling their way out of spilling blood.
That makes “Girls Trip” seem tamer than a movie like “Rough Night.” But “Girls Trip” is also funnier; it’s also more appealing because it knows that there’s more at stake existentially for women, and especially for black women, than out-grossing men. The friends in “Girls Trip” have other issues to work on, all of which are grounded in ordinary life: how to live in the world with love and joy, how to nurture intimate relationships so they don’t slip away, how to balance professional and personal obligations without going nuts, how to perform fairly tricky sexual acts without embarrassing you or your partner right out of bed — you know, the usual.
An invitation brings the friends and story in “Girls Trip” together. It’s sent by Ryan (Regina Hall), an entrepreneurial self-help guru who is rapidly heading toward Oprah-level celebrity. With a megawatt smile, an affirmation for every occasion and a beautiful husband by her side (a thankless role, capably handled by Mike Colter), Ryan seems to have it all. She’s turned her life into a brand by selling other women on the idea that they can have it all, too, but now she’s not so sure. After being tapped to speak at the Essence Festival in New Orleans, she invites three friends along for a weekend of sharing, caring and boozing, topped with guest turns from the likes of Common and Sean Combs.
Enjoyment turns out to be contagious in “Girls Trip,” which consistently manages to rework and even reinvigorate some severely worn-out conceits, setups and character types, mostly by complicating gender roles with class issues. The struggler is Sasha (Queen Latifah), a former serious journalist turned flailing gossip blogger; the wallflower, Lisa (Jada Pinkett Smith), is a nurse and single mom; the cutup, Dina (Tiffany Haddish), well, it’s unclear what she does. She works, kind of, in an office or did — even her boss seems baffled about her status — but mostly Dina is the crazy snake in the can, the whoopee in the cushion and the movie’s biggest, rowdiest laugh generator.
The director Malcolm D. Lee (“The Best Man”) helps turn these types into characters efficiently and sympathetically — he knows how to light and frame a beautiful face — though every so often you sense he would like to cut loose visually. Mostly, he serves Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver’s script, which goes high, low and sincere as it mixes some slapstick in with the sober bits, giddily indulges its freewheeling silliness and drops heart-to-hearts ranging from a sharply comic lesson on white privilege to a hilarious riff on the joys of grapefruit sex. (Ms. Oliver and Mr. Barris, who created the sitcom “black-ish,” also wrote “Barbershop: The Next Cut,” which Mr. Lee directed.)
Like most movies of this comic ilk, including the male-centric “Hangover” types, “Girls Trip” is effectively a narrative striptease. Characters — mostly ordinary, straight, middle-class types — take some of it off, the “it” being the cultural and social norms that define and often restrict them: the veneer of respectability, the accommodating smiles, the regulation control. At times this involves female characters testing, gingerly if fleetingly, the limits of that construct called femininity. “Girls Trip” adds complexity to the picture by bringing in class, even as it dispatches with whiteness, showing it the door so that these women can find themselves while rediscovering the power and pleasures of sisterhood." 0.901928098 "Comedy" "R" "Universal" "$19,000,000 " "$31,201,920 " "$115,171,585 " "" "668" "27-Aug-93" "" "" NA

Like Johnny (Josh O’Connor), who labors on his struggling family farm in Yorkshire under the critical eyes of his sick father (Ian Hart) and stolid grandmother (Gemma Jones). For relief, he vents his frustrations in binge-drinking and furtive, feral sex with random young men.
These taciturn encounters, unfolding as unsentimentally as the internal exam he gives a pregnant heifer, suggest someone disgusted by his own sorry self. But this bracing, sometimes brutal movie — the feature debut of the writer and director Francis Lee — doesn’t present Johnny’s sexuality as the cause of his self-loathing. Rather, it’s his imprisonment by a legacy he’s not sure he wants that ties his tongue and clots his emotions.
Both are about to be loosened. The arrival of Gheorghe (Alec Secareanu), a gentle, darkly handsome Romanian migrant worker, softens Johnny’s heart and the movie’s tone. Their passion isn’t pretty, but awkward and pasty and explicit: two frantic strangers grappling in the muck of the moors. Yet Gheorghe is skilled at handling more than newborn lambs; and as the men grow closer, the glowering light grows warmer and the whole picture seems to briefly exhale.
Filmed with a naturalism that recalls Andrea Arnold’s 2012 dive into “Wuthering Heights,” “God’s Own Country” weaves a rough magic from Joshua James Richards’s biting cinematography and the story’s slow, unsteady arc from bitter to hopeful. Bodily fluids — bestial and human — stain the screen, punctuating a story that’s as much about rediscovering place as finding love.

It’s a remake of a 1979 movie that starred three big names on the back end of their careers, George Burns, Art Carney and Lee Strasberg. The new version matches that star power with Michael Caine, Alan Arkin and Morgan Freeman, working amusingly together as retirees who find themselves in need of money or excitement or both and decide to rob a bank.
These types of films always take pains to point out that gray hair and wrinkles don’t equal comatose — before the story is through, pot has been smoked, vigorous sex has been enjoyed, and the gents have done an almost perfect job of outsmarting the detective (Matt Dillon) who is investigating the robbery. On the other hand, Christopher Lloyd turns up as a wild-eyed eccentric who embodies an awful lot of senior-citizen stereotypes.

Swaybacked and paunchy, with a thinning dome and an appetite for Winstons and Seagram’s that would keep both brands in business if the rest of the world went cold turkey, Kenny doesn’t quite have the wolfish charisma or the mystical intensity of some of Mr. McConaughey’s other recent characters. But like them — like Mick Haller in “The Lincoln Lawyer,” Ron Woodroof in “Dallas Buyers Club” and that guy in those car commercials — he is fun to watch and hard not to root for.
“Gold,” which chronicles a few of Kenny’s rises and falls in the 1980s, describes itself as “inspired by actual events,” but inspiration is precisely what the film, directed by Stephen Gaghan from a script by Patrick Massett and John Zinman, seems to lack. Mr. McConaughey is a ball of profane, entrepreneurial energy bouncing around in a vacuum. The story swings from the Nevada desert to the Indonesian rain forest to Wall Street boardrooms, and the screen bristles with signifiers of capitalist activity: meetings, phone calls, stock tickers. But the movie isn’t really doing any work. It’s just looking busy.
Having nearly run the family prospecting business into the ground (so to speak), Kenny gambles on the expertise of a Mike Acosta (Édgar Ramírez), a geologist with an almost mystical reputation. They strike gold in Indonesia, and a gilded future opens up for Kenny and his longtime girlfriend, Kaylene (Bryce Dallas Howard). There are shadows and complications, of course, including the corruptions of wealth, the treachery of rivals and Kenny’s own impulsiveness. Broad hints are dropped that things will end badly.
But enough goes wrong along the way — with the movie, I mean, not with Mike and Kenny’s scheme — to make the outcome feel almost moot. The film is well cast: You can’t really go wrong with Bill Camp, Corey Stoll, Stacy Keach and Bruce Greenwood. It’s beautifully shot (you can’t go wrong with Robert Elswit, either). There is a pleasingly sleazy, swaggering, brown-tinted ’80s vibe. And there are flickering reminders of other ambitious, money-chasing mock epics, as if the filmmakers were hoping an algorithm would deposit “Gold” in the queues of viewers who liked “American Hustle,” “The Big Short” and Mr. Gaghan’s own “Syriana.”
With this material, he could have gone in any number of interesting directions, which may have been part of the problem. “Gold” could have been a biting satire of greed and folly, a neo-Conradian tale of Western misadventure in Asia, a rousing fable of underdog triumph or a caper comedy. It tries, in its frantic, clumsy fashion, to be all of those things, and comes close enough to succeeding to qualify as an honorable failure.
What holds your attention is the question of whether that description fits Kenny as well. He could just as well be the opposite — a dishonorable success. He is far from a subtle guy, but Mr. McConaughey is a sly enough actor to make us wonder whether we’re in the company of a fool or a con artist and to make us question whether there’s really a difference. His wild, abrasive and improbably delicate performance is what makes “Gold” watchable, even if the rest of the movie doesn’t supply sufficient reason to keep watching." 0.79149375 "Adventure" "R" "Weinstein Company" "" "$3,471,316 " "$7,227,038 " "" "149" "18-Sep-98" "" "" NA

Motivated by a volatile mix of desperation and bravado, he involves Nick in a poorly planned, haphazardly executed bank robbery. You can bet money on a disastrous outcome, though you might not foresee the precise sequence of mayhem and farce that unfolds on the streets of Queens over a single freezing night. The caper includes an after-hours visit to an amusement park, a soda bottle full of LSD, a case of mistaken identity and plenty of chases, beatings and narrow escapes.
The Safdies are as clever and crafty as Connie is inept and impulsive. “Good Time,” their third co-directed fictional feature — after the autobiographical “Daddy Longlegs” and the addiction romance “Heaven Knows What” — moves smartly and propulsively to the stressed-out strains of Daniel Lopatin’s edge-of-a-heart-attack score. The smudgy, grimy urban landscape — emergency rooms, fast-food restaurants, blocks of modest, over-mortgaged, squeezed-together houses — is shot (by Sean Price Williams) with a fastidious avoidance of prettiness. The story doesn’t twist and turn so much as squirm and jump like an eel in the bottom of a rowboat. The biggest surprises confirm what an unbelievable slimeball Connie is. He’s about as hard to root for as any movie outlaw you can think of.
And yet, partly because Mr. Pattinson’s movie-star incandescence can’t quite be obscured by facial hair and bad lighting, and partly because of the immutable laws of genre and spectacle, you sort of have no choice but to root for him. You’re stuck with him, and you might as well make the best of it. The Safdies have explored this kind of ambiguity before. In “Daddy Longlegs,” the wayward father, played by Ronald Bronstein (a character based on their own father), was appalling and charming in almost equal measure; his charisma both enabled and camouflaged his wanton irresponsibility. You might have recoiled in horror at his recklessness, but you couldn’t deny that he loved his kids.
Connie, for his part, adores his brother and has a way with dogs. While these traits don’t exactly make him likable, they grant him a minimal benefit of the doubt. His manipulation of his girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) isn’t nice, but on the other hand she is so whiny and needy that you can’t feel too bad. Connie also has the good luck (at least as far as the audience’s good graces are concerned) of falling in with the one guy in Queens who could make him look like a criminal genius — a gangly doofus named Ray (Buddy Duress), who has been spending his first days out of jail aggressively pursuing the opposite of rehabilitation.
This pair is not exactly Butch and Sundance, even in their own addled, delusional minds. And while Ray is hapless and almost heroically stupid, Connie is a more complicated, less clownish figure. He has a hint of heart, as well as a cruel, predatory streak that the Safdies’ expose for shocks and laughs, daring you to either take offense or take the joke, and banking on your queasiness in either case.
It doesn’t take much looking to notice an ugly racial dimension in Connie’s behavior, though most critics overlooked it when the film was shown in Cannes this spring. When the Nikas brothers carry out the bank job, they wear hard hats, reflective vests and dark latex masks that function as crude, criminal blackface. Later, Connie takes advantage of a Caribbean immigrant (Gladys Mathon) and her granddaughter (Taliah Lennice Webster), sweet-talking and bullying them into aiding and abetting him. A black security guard (Barkhad Abdi) becomes another brutally abused pawn in Connie’s senseless game.
This pattern does not seem accidental. The question is what it means — what degree of self-consciousness or critical distance “Good Time” brings to its depiction of bottom-of-the-barrel white privilege. You could infer a satirical dimension if you wanted to, or even a righteous indictment of what a lowlife can get away with if he has Mr. Pattinson’s complexion. Or you could look at the film’s riot of racial signifiers — the musical and pop-cultural references as well as the demographics of the setting — as a form of trolling, a coy, self-disavowing provocation.
But the distinction doesn’t really matter, since the movie’s chief investment is not in the fates of any of its characters, nor in anything like realism, but rather in its own cool. Sometimes it flaunts its clichés — Nick’s disability, and Benny Safdie’s slack-jawed portrayal of it, is a big one — and other times it cloaks them in rough visual textures and jumpy, bumpy camera movements, so that a rickety genre thrill ride feels like something daring and new. It isn’t. It’s stale, empty and cold." 0.074166757 "Crime" "R" "A24" "" "" "$2,026,499 " "" "5" "17-Sep-04" "4-Nov-04" "49" 7

He is Smith Bhatnagar (his parents wanted a common American moniker but didn’t quite grasp the distinction between first and last names), and if the actor playing him, Roni Akurati, isn’t as polished as some young stars, he’s good enough for the material. Smith has a crush on a neighbor, Amy (Brighton Sharbino), who befriends him in a neighborhood and school that seem full of bullies intolerant of his accent and culture. Amy’s father, Butch (Jason Lee), the movie’s best-developed character, becomes a rock for Smith despite battling personal demons.
The film, directed by Frank Lotito, uses the device common in coming-of-age movies, narration by the adult Smith (Samrat Chakrabarti). The movie has a roughly equal number of clumsy moments and sweet ones. In the most endearing vignette, young Smith goes hunting with Butch, learning a lesson about guns and a lesson about himself as well.
The film has accidental topicality now with the debate over immigration swirling, but you don’t need to burden it with politics to be touched by its tale of a child who is pulled by two very different cultural worlds. Best of all, the story has some surprises as it makes its way toward the inevitable where-is-he-now moment when we see how young Smith’s life turned out." 0.89754042 "Comedy" "PG-13" "Good Deed" "" "$5,975 " "$14,760 " "$694,905 " "108" "19-Nov-10" "16-Dec-10" "28" 4

In many respects, it’s not much different except it all feels a bit strained, as if everyone were trying too hard, especially its writer-director, James Gunn. Most of the ragtag futuristic fighters who powered through Vol 1. three years ago are back on board and led by Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), a cheerily roguish type who calls himself Star-Lord. The name still brings a light smile, even if the movie can’t help but feel as deadly serious as any other lucratively branded Marvel property.
It’s tough being a hitmaker who isn’t weighed down by corporate expectations, but for a while, Mr. Gunn does a pretty good job of keeping the whole thing reasonably fizzy, starting with an opener that winks at the audience with big bangs and slapstick. The movie begins in medias res, with Quill and the gang facing down a blobby adversary with fat, snapping tentacles and rows of nasty teeth — the better to eat them with or just tear them limb from limb. The Guardians take whacks at the blob, jumping and thrashing around a patently digital environment that’s vaguely far-out and indeterminate.
These introductions are fairly chaotic, which is the usual blockbuster way. The point is to telegraph the movie you’re about to watch — the threats, fights and winks followed by more threats, fights and winks — as well as to reintroduce the crew members, their skills, traits and foibles. Alternately bulgy and sleek, hairy and shticky, they make for often-amusing company, even if this time Zoe Saldana, as Gamora, the green-skinned Amazon with grave daddy issues, feels more sidelined than before. One problem, it seems, is that Mr. Gunn is still holding off on developing the romance between her and Peter that was teased in the first movie, probably because he’s saving it for the next installment.
The larger problem, as it becomes progressively evident, is that this series lacks a resonant origin story, a myth, on which a world, multiple stories and a fan base can rest. The Guardians’ personal stories are continuing to emerge, and the meme that’s in circulation is family, which at times makes it feel as if the movie is taking cues from the “Fast and Furious” franchise. This explains the testy, at times violent and generally dreary exchanges between Gamora and her sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan), a bald badass itching to deliver payback for their rotten childhood. The performers look fierce as they slam around, squaring jaws and giving good side-eye, but it just feels like narrative filler.
For the most part, Mr. Gunn puts much of his storytelling energy into filling in Quill’s origins, after having already dispatched Mom in the first movie. This doesn’t sound promising and isn’t, alas, despite the good will that Kurt Russell brings to the part of Quill’s father, Ego. At one point, Mr. Russell, or some version of him, assays the role with a weird, disrupting digital face-lift that’s meant to suggest the young Ego, but really only makes you contemplate whether this Benjamin Button-style age-reversing is going to become an increasingly standard (and creepy) industry practice. It’s a distraction that shows a filmmaker making a bad decision mostly, it seems, because he can afford to.
Still, before Mr. Russell is swallowed up by the story and digital effects, he holds you with the laid-back vibe of a Hollywood veteran whose tan and crinkly smile tell you that sunsets and Goldie Hawn are waiting for him back in Cali. He brings an unforced looseness to the movie that it very much needs, especially after Mr. Pratt slips into a more sober register in his daddy dearest scenes. Mr. Gunn likes to play a scene straight and then jokingly pull the rug out from under it, a trick that, among other things, helps soft-sell the violence. But the father-son stuff plays flatly less because it’s been told before (like, forever) than because he can’t figure out how to playfully kink it up.
At times, Mr. Gunn’s ambitions badly backfire. Like the first movie, this one is jammed with action-driven sequences, some wildly bloated and most of them cartoonish. For one fight, though, he cranks the music and lets the screen bleed as the ostensible good guys kill one villain after another, the casualties falling to the sound of a head-bobbing song. Tonally, the episode feels unpleasantly sour and wrong for this young series, which is best when it goes light; it’s a bummer watching another director attempt the kind of smiling sadism that not even Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino can always pull off.
In moments like this, Mr. Gunn loses sight of the insouciance and feeling that were crucial to making the first movie work. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” certainly has its attractions, but most of them are visual rather than narrative. Among the most appealing are the animated diorama-like tableaus that Ego uses to narrate his life, each a clue to his character. His private planet, meanwhile, is a kaleidoscopic fantasia that suggests modestly trippy science-fiction and heavy-metal cover art. This look — with its softly clashing colors and soaring stalagmites — seems designed to instigate, at least in some, flashbacks to stacks of yellowing paperbacks and lovingly played rock albums.
Like some of the canned music (Fleetwood Mac, the Electric Light Orchestra), the movie’s visual design gestures toward the past but mostly comes across as a generational yearning for such memories. Perhaps like some directors, Mr. Gunn fondly or regretfully looks back on a time when studio filmmakers could more or less do their own thing cinematically. Or maybe he just likes songs like “Come a Little Bit Closer,” a Top 40 hit about a fickle dance partner that works as a nice metaphor for every movie that wants to fall into the audience’s embrace, at least on opening weekend. The difference is that while the first “Guardians” earned that love as if by accident, this one begs for it." 0.920377578 "Action" "PG-13" "Buena Vista" "$200,000,000 " "$146,510,104 " "$389,813,101 " "" "1,953" "17-Feb-95" "" "" NA

The person in need of improvement is Tree (an unimprovable Jessica Rothe), a selfish sorority sister who’s mean to her perfectly nice roommate and much too friendly with her married professor. Waking up on her birthday in a strange man’s dorm room after a supposed one night stand, she stumbles through her day until, en route to her surprise party that night, she is brutally murdered by a masked attacker. Unfortunately, she’s about to experience this particular day again — multiple times.
Niftily paced and tight as a chokehold, the script (by the comic-book writer Scott Lobdell) delivers just enough variation to hold our interest. The means of Tree’s expirations are unoriginal and not especially scary, but the director, Christopher Landon, maintains a breezy momentum while she wakes, runs, croaks and repeats. With each resurrection, she’s in slightly worse shape, but marginally better-tempered, giving Ms. Rothe room to deepen the character and arc from unsympathetic victim to loving girlfriend.
Rarely out of our sight, Ms. Rothe is inexhaustible and funny, with Israel Broussard a perfect foil as her bemused, sweetly bland love interest. But it’s the newcomer Rachel Matthews as Danielle, the snippy sorority president, who’s the natural comedian.

His latest picture, “Happy End,” begins with the middle of its wide-screen frame taken up by the perfectly centered image of a phone, its camera eavesdropping on a middle-age woman whose bathroom door is open as she prepares for bed. The unseen voyeur texts snide commentary on the woman’s routine.
Mr. Haneke, whose technical mastery often makes his considered existential dyspepsia easier to swallow, doesn’t establish an explicit motivation for the spy — the 13-year-old Eve, the second-youngest member of the singularly unhappy Laurent family, whose story this movie tells. The Laurents, a most high-bourgeois clan, are besieged by trouble. Its patriarch, Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant), retains some mental sharpness in his 80s, but he’s losing his memory, and he’d like to get out — that is, die — while he still has some faculties left. His son Thomas (Mathieu Kassovitz) has brought his daughter Eve (Fantine Harduin) to stay with him and his new wife and baby after Eve’s mother attempted suicide. (Thomas also has a mistress, whom Eve learns about while cyber-eavesdropping on her father.) They are all living in the family’s Calais mansion with Eve’s aunt, Anne (Isabelle Huppert), who is trying to keep the family construction business afloat, a task not helped much by her wayward son, Pierre (Franz Rogowski), or a fatal accident at a building site.
“Happy End” has a linear structure, but Mr. Haneke presents his scenes with little or no connective tissue. Instead of conventional transitions, there are abrupt shifts that resemble clicking through channels on a television. A scene of domestic disorder will cut to a web video in which an adolescent boy giddily chronicles his hair and skateboarding styles from videos past, and the movie lets this clip roll on quite a while before showing us that it’s something Eve is watching on her computer. This strategy has a distancing effect, but also forces the viewer to stay on his or her toes.
It also constitutes a bit of misdirection, in that there is a bigger picture outside of this chronicle of self-absorption. The Laurents, as what some would call wealth creators, have, in Mr. Haneke’s view, some responsibility to and for a whole class of people who aren’t even abstractions to them. Aside from their servants, members of the working class — both the documented and undocumented — are not often seen in this movie, but the times they are made visible are significant. They appear at key points in the movie, as when Georges, in a wheelchair after his attempted suicide-by-car fails, rolls down a street, festooned with tacky little shops, and stops in front of a group of men, most likely African immigrants. We can’t hear what he’s asking of them, but we can guess. The character’s presumption is staggering on several levels.
Like many of Mr. Haneke’s films from the past two decades, “Happy End” is set in France and features a mostly French-speaking cast. It has an uncommonly strong ensemble cast (including Toby Jones, who plays Anne’s English lover and business ally), but the movie belongs to Mr. Trintignant. At the height of his career, his nuanced performing mode achieved an almost supernatural perfection, whether he was playing a romantically hapless intellectual (in “My Night at Maud’s,” released in the United States in 1970), a stoic racecar driver (in “A Man and a Woman,” 1966) or a fascist dupe (in “The Conformist,” 1970). Here, he is both steely and vulnerable in a role in which he has almost no physical movements to perform. In the movie’s central scene, a long conversation with the troubled Eve, he merely has to move his head forward, or crook a finger, to throw a world out of its orbit." 0.703032533 "Drama" "R" "Sony Classics" "" "$9,930 " "$14,974 " "$11,171 " "2" "10-Aug-07" "4-Nov-07" "70" 10

Yet the atmosphere of dread that Mr. Fukada tends with such ruthless precision — and more than a little sadism — depends not on creepy camera moves or other visual trickery. Instead, this chilly tale of violent secrets and unvoiced misery relies heavily on the skill of actors who seem to know that one false move could tip the whole enterprise into comedy.
Even before the arrival of the mysterious Mr. Yasaka (Tadanobu Asano), the marriage of Toshio (Kanji Furutachi), the owner of a small machine shop, and his self-effacing wife, Akie (Mariko Tsutsui), appears passionless. Polite but distant, they share meals and the care of their small daughter, Hotaru, with so little intimacy that when Toshio offers Yasaka a room and a job, he doesn’t even ask his wife’s opinion. All too soon, though, he’ll have cause to regret his impulsiveness.
A companion piece to Mr. Fukada’s 2010 comedy, “Hospitalité,” “Harmonium” binds not one but two broken families in a clammy union of tragedy and seduction. As Yasaka’s presence in the household becomes ever more disruptive, the story veers in unexpected directions, leaping over years before landing with wrenching ambiguity. Yet the implacable pacing and Kenichi Negishi’s unruffled cinematography shape Yasaka into a near-mythic instrument of destruction.

Harold, the storyboard artist husband, and Lillian, the film researcher wife, were a prolific team whose careers are being profiled in Daniel Raim’s documentary “Harold and Lillian: A Hollywood Love Story.”
Through charming animated sketches and interviews with the couple and some of their friends, like Mel Brooks, Francis Ford Coppola and Danny DeVito, the documentary reflects on the couple’s work together — often with Mrs. Michelson’s findings inspiring her husband’s art.
Mr. Michelson, who died in 2007, climbed the industry ladder as a storyboard artist, eventually becoming an art director and production designer. Not wanting to stay at home, Mrs. Michelson volunteered at a studio library and became a sought-after film researcher.
Their behind-the-scenes influence on filmmakers was far-reaching. Mr. Michelson’s storyboards show sketched versions of memorable scenes, like the parting of the Red Sea in “The Ten Commandments” and Anne Bancroft’s raised leg overshadowing Dustin Hoffman in “The Graduate.” Mrs. Michelson excitedly recalls interviewing women at Canter’s Deli in Los Angeles about traditional costumes for “Fiddler on the Roof” and questioning a drug kingpin for “Scarface.”
The stories are told out of order to make room for personal tangents, including the challenges of raising an autistic son in the 1960s.

And now, somewhere between the two, lies “Hello Again,” Tom Gustafson’s florid adaptation of Michael John LaChiusa’s 1993 Off Broadway show (itself based on Arthur Schnitzler’s “La Ronde”). What most distinguishes “Hello Again” from the others is its cast of New York theater powerhouses, including Martha Plimpton, Audra McDonald and Cheyenne Jackson.
“Hello Again” largely eschews dialogue as it leaps among historical eras and song sequences, depicting a series of fraught romantic encounters across decades. (Few film musicals have so teemed with non-graphic scenes of sexual acts.)
It begins with a woman (Ms. Plimpton) who enters a peep-show-like chamber, seeking counsel about love from a mysterious masked man before her. And then it’s off to a coupling between a prostitute and a soldier in 1901; a tryst between a rich man (T. R. Knight) and a younger one on the Titanic; a 1920s affair in a movie theater involving an adulteress (Rumer Willis); a Greenwich Village disco hookup in the 1970s; and so on. The best comes near the end, when Ms. McDonald, as a singer in 2002 reaching for a comeback in a cheesy music video, puts Auto-Tune to shame. A later segment takes place in 1989, in which Ms. Plimpton plays a Washington senator keeping her lover (Ms. McDonald) a secret. Their scenes together are worth the price of admission.
The movie benefits from Austin Schmidt’s neon-infused cinematography and Annie Simeone’s lush production design. But Mr. LaChiusa’s songs largely fail to resonate here. Dramatic traction suffers, probably as a result of the many, and diffuse, vignettes. And yet this is a commendably audacious effort by Mr. Gustafson (“Were the World Mine”).

"120" "Hidden Figures" "1/6/2017" "12/22/2016" "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/movies/hidden-figures-review.html" 0 "“Hidden Figures” takes us back to 1961, when racial segregation and workplace sexism were widely accepted facts of life and the word “computer” referred to a person, not a machine. Though a gigantic IBM mainframe does appear in the movie — big enough to fill a room and probably less powerful than the phone in your pocket — the most important computers are three African-American women who work at NASA headquarters in Hampton, Va. Assigned to data entry jobs and denied recognition or promotion, they would go on to play crucial roles in the American space program.
Based on Margot Lee Shetterly’s nonfiction book of the same title, the film, directed by Theodore Melfi (who wrote the script with Allison Schroeder), turns the entwined careers of Katherine Goble (later Johnson), Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan into a rousing celebration of merit rewarded and perseverance repaid. Like many movies about the overcoming of racism, it offers belated acknowledgment of bravery and talent and an overdue reckoning with the sins of the past. And like most movies about real-world breakthroughs, “Hidden Figures” is content to stay within established conventions. The story may be new to most viewers, but the manner in which it’s told will be familiar to all but the youngest.
This is not necessarily a bad thing. There is something to be said for a well-told tale with a clear moral and a satisfying emotional payoff. Mr. Melfi, whose previous film was the heart-tugging, borderline-treacly Bill Murray vehicle “St. Vincent,” knows how to push our emotional buttons without too heavy a hand. He trusts his own skill, the intrinsic interest of the material and — above all — the talent and dedication of the cast. From one scene to the next, you may know more or less what is coming, but it is never less than delightful to watch these actors at work.
Start with the three principals, whose struggles at NASA take place as the agency is scrambling to send an astronaut into orbit. Katherine Goble is the central hidden figure, a mathematical prodigy played with perfect nerd charisma by Taraji P. Henson. Katherine is plucked from the computing room and assigned to a team that will calculate the launch coordinates and trajectory for an Atlas rocket. She receives a cold welcome — particularly from an engineer named Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) — and is not spared the indignities facing a black woman in a racially segregated, gender-stratified workplace. The only bathroom she is allowed to use is in a distant building, and she horrifies her new co-workers when she helps herself to a cup of coffee.
Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) and Mary (Janelle Monáe) also face discrimination. Dorothy, who is in charge of several dozen computers, is repeatedly denied promotion to supervisor and treated with condescension by her immediate boss (Kirsten Dunst). The Polish-born engineer (Olek Krupa) with whom Mary works is more enlightened, but Mary runs into the brick wall of Virginia’s Jim Crow laws when she tries to take graduate-level physics courses.
“Hidden Figures” effectively conveys the poisonous normalcy of white supremacy, and the main characters’ determination to pursue their ambitions in spite of it and to live normal lives in its shadow. The racism they face does not depend on the viciousness or virtue of individual white people, and for the most part the white characters are not treated as heroes for deciding, at long last, to behave decently. Two of them, however, are singled out for commendation: John Glenn, portrayed by Glen Powell as a natural democrat with no time for racial hierarchies; and Al Harrison, the head of Katherine’s group, for whom the success of the mission is more important than color.
Kevin Costner, who plays Al, is an actor almost uniquely capable of upstaging through understatement. He is also one of the great gum-chewers in American cinema, a habit that, along with the flattop haircut and heavy-framed glasses, gives Al an aura of midcentury no-nonsense masculine competence. He desegregates the NASA bathrooms with a sledgehammer and stands up for Katherine in quieter but no less emphatic ways when her qualifications are challenged.
It’s a bit much, maybe, but Mr. Costner, as usual, does what he can to give the white men of America a good name. The movie, meanwhile, expands the schoolbook chronicle of the conquest of space beyond the usual heroes, restoring some of its idealism and grandeur in the process. It also embeds that history in daily life, departing from the televised spectacle of liftoffs and landings and the public drama of the civil rights movement to spend time with its heroines and their families at home and in church. The sweetest subplot involves the romance between Katherine, a widow with three daughters, and a handsome military officer played by Mahershala Ali.
“Hidden Figures” makes a fascinating and timely companion to “Loving,” Jeff Nichols’s film about the Virginia couple who challenged their state’s law against interracial marriage, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1967. The two movies take place in the same state in the same era, and focus on the quiet dramas that move history forward. They introduce you to real people you might wish you had known more about earlier. They can fill you with outrage at the persistence of injustice and gratitude toward those who had the grit to stand up against it." 0.995448196 "Drama" "PG" "Fox" "$25,000,000 " "" "$169,607,287 " "" "1,423" "22-Mar-85" "" "" NA

Set in a remote small town in Canada, “Hollow in the Land” follows Alison (Dianna Agron) as she struggles to look after her troublesome brother, Brandon (Jared Abrahamson). Their mother is long gone, and their jailbird father is still locked up. When Brandon is accused of murder, he disappears, leaving Alison alone to exonerate him.
Soon this gloomy family drama, directed and written by Scooter Corkle, transforms into a backwoods thriller littered with bodies and conspiracies.
Under the film’s color-drained cinematography, Alison looks tired and pallid as she’s harassed and chased away by locals who despise her family.

The movie mirrors Alison’s desperation through dimly lit dead-end clues and hectic chase sequences through town.
Alison closely resembles Jennifer Lawrence’s character in “Winter’s Bone,” another self-sufficient young woman whose family and community turn against her.

Her life is as fluffed as a throw pillow and so drained of realism it is best described as a lifestyle, which can make for a killer aspirational fantasy, at least in Nancy Meyers’s hands.
“Home Again,” on the other hand, is wholly resistible, partly because it can’t fulfill the promise of that aspirational fantasy either on a craft level or in terms of its emotional and psychological portraiture. The problems begin with the script, or perhaps just with the insulting idea that Alice would be crying buckets into a mirror because she’s turning 40 on the day the story opens. Yes, she is newly separated from her music-industry husband (Michael Sheen), who likes to take calls from his New York office with its sweeping view. Alice doesn’t seem too bent out of shape by the separation. She’s busy building a new career as an interior decorator, and has moved with her two daughters into her childhood home, which she has redecorated to look like something out of a lower-budget Nancy Meyers movie.
So why is Alice crying? Mostly to try to jump-start a movie that, formulaic step by step, needs to confirm that a single woman can be happy. You go, girl. That’s more or less it, with accent pieces and yoga lessons, though there are plot complications, some involving three friends, white dudes who had a hit at a film festival and now have a power agency behind them, several freelance gigs and, of course, the promise of great shining futures as Hollywood filmmakers. The three shack up in Alice’s guesthouse and soon they’re all one smiley family, which might be odd because they’re strangers and she has young daughters — except that this isn’t reality, it’s a bubble.
Of course it is. Its three dudes, who sail from festival hype to Hollywood, evoke the fairy-tale trajectories of directors like Colin Trevorrow, who went from making a tiny movie to “Jurassic World.” Ms. Meyers-Shyer has taken a parallel path, one followed by members of the Coppola clan. Ms. Meyers helped produce “Home Again” and her former husband and filmmaking partner, Charles Shyer, served as their daughter’s second unit director. Alice’s dead father was a director, too. Canisters of film sit, no doubt decaying, in a sun-filled room, the same one in which his Oscar — the apotheosis of this movie’s aspirational thinking — stands as a shining testament to a daughter’s love and her picture’s absurdity." 0.223004171 "Comedy" "PG-13" "Open Road Films" "$12,000,000 " "$8,567,881 " "$27,020,284 " "" "1,100" "11-Jun-93" "" "" NA
"123" "I Called Him Morgan" "3/24/2017" "3/23/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/movies/i-called-him-morgan-review.html" 0 "In February 1972, in the midst of a blizzard, the jazz trumpeter Lee Morgan died after being shot in a Manhattan nightclub by his common-law wife, Helen. The shooting was tragic and traumatic for those who were there — one of Morgan’s band mates stayed away from New York for many years after — but for the rest of the world, it has the qualities of a sad, strange, faded tabloid story.
“I Called Him Morgan,” a suave and poignant documentary by Kasper Collin, dusts off the details of Morgan’s life and death and brushes away the sensationalism, too. This is not a lurid true-crime tale of jealousy and drug addiction, but a delicate human drama about love, ambition and the glories of music. Edged with blues and graced with that elusive quality called swing, the film makes generous and judicious use of Morgan’s recordings. The scarcity of film clips and audio of Morgan’s voice is made up for by vivid black-and-white photographs and immortal tracks from the Blue Note catalog.
There are fewer pictures of Helen Morgan, who didn’t like to be photographed. But shortly before she died, in 1996, she recorded a series of interviews with Larry Reni Thomas, an adult-education instructor and radio host in Wilmington, N.C., where she was living at the time. Her voice — candid, funny and haunting — offers the counterpoint in a double biography, a chronicle of tenderness and self-destruction.
The former Helen More grew up in poverty in rural North Carolina and escaped, at 17, to New York, where she established herself as, among other things, a kind of den mother to the jazz scene. Her apartment in the West 50s, not far from Birdland, was a place where musicians gathered to mingle, listen to records and eat her famous cooking. One of them was Lee Morgan, who met his future lover at a low point in his career, in the mid-1960s, when he risked squandering his early promise and crossover success in the service of his heroin habit.
He had arrived in New York a decade earlier, a jug-eared, fleet-fingered teenage prodigy discovered by Dizzy Gillespie and nurtured by Art Blakey. Slender, stylish and ebullient, Morgan played the trumpet with speed, precision and an infectiousness that Mr. Collin wisely pauses to savor.
He also lingers over the reminiscences of Morgan’s colleagues — including Wayne Shorter, Paul West and Jymie Merritt — whose testimony provides a lesson in musical history and a primer on jazz aesthetics. Their bearing in interviews carries some of the essential qualities of the music: the wit, the dignity, the mixture of passionate feeling and critical intelligence. You could listen to these men talk all day, and then listen to them play all night.
You are always aware that Morgan is missing from their company, that he should have grown into an elder statesman alongside them. Regret isn’t the film’s only key, though. Helen, Lee’s senior by more than a decade, restored him to health and nurtured a creative rebirth. “I Called Him Morgan” lingers in the period of their happiness, as Helen recalls it, and doesn’t strain to make sense of the senseless violence that ended it.
What happened that night seems as simple and as mysterious as a murder ballad, and yet at the same time, more a terrible accident than a full-blown tragedy. It’s startling to realize how young Morgan was — 32 or 33, depending on which news article you believe — given how much he had lived. But that’s what art does, including documentary film: It expands the scope of life and distills its beauty and its pain." 0.99849131 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Submarine Deluxe" "" "$2,583 " "$2,583 " "$957,668 " "12" "29-Apr-05" "4-Jul-05" "70" 10

Until I Don’t,” Lake Bell’s pained sex comedy, is that there’s a lot of money in happy endings. And not the kind that are typically tacked onto movies like this one.
Rather, the massage-parlor treat promised here is an anniversary gift from Cybil (Mary Steenburgen) to her longtime husband, Harvey (Paul Reiser). But the giving is itself an act of such passive-aggressive loathing that it all but destroys any comedic potential in their relationship, never mind any desire we might have to see their union endure.
In that we’re joined by Vivian (Dolly Wells), a bitter British filmmaker who believes marriage to be unsustainable. To prove her thesis, she has enlisted Cybil and Harvey plus two more fractured Florida couples for what she is pleased to call a documentary. Ms. Bell (who also wrote the preposterous script) and Ed Helms play an unhappily childless twosome who practice “results-based” sex by means of a phone app that tracks ovarian cycles. And Amber Heard and Wyatt Cenac are hippie-dippie caricatures whose free-love philosophy is as much a sham as Vivian’s filmmaking ethics.
Painted in the broadest possible strokes, these ropy relationships agitate a movie that has neither a coherent point nor an authentic character. There’s little evidence here of the talent that made Ms. Bell’s 2013 filmmaking debut, “In a World ...” (about struggling voice-over artists), as gentle and genuine as this one is abrasive and cartoonish.

"125" "I, Tonya" "12/8/2017" "12/6/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/movies/i-tonya-review-margot-robbie.html" 0 "The subject of “I, Tonya” — a winking, eager-to-please, fictionalized gloss on the disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding — gets roughed up a lot. As a child, she is degraded and smacked around by her mother, who kicks little Tonya’s chair so violently the kid flies off it. When the teenage Tonya gets involved with the man she will marry, her life as a punching bag continues. Her husband smashes her head onto a glass surface so hard that shards scatter; he bloodies her nose a few times. He also points a gun at Tonya, threatening to kill her. Despite all the beatings and blood, “I, Tonya” insists it’s a comedy.
The real Tonya Harding went from fame to infamy in 1994, after she was implicated in an attack on Nancy Kerrigan, a rival. On Jan. 6, after practicing for the United States Figure Skating Championships in Detroit, Ms. Kerrigan was attacked by a man who thwacked her leg with a collapsible police baton. (He seems to have been going for her knee.) A camera captured Ms. Kerrigan on the ground as she repeatedly wailed “Why?” Ms. Harding went on to win the championship; it was a short-lived victory. The F.B.I. was soon questioning her, her ex-husband and their dumb-and-dumber associates. By June, Ms. Harding had been barred from competing for her role in the attack.
Energetically directed by Craig Gillespie, “I, Tonya” charts the hard-won rise and calamitous fall of its title character (Margot Robbie). Taking the form of a mock, mocking documentary, one that disjointedly swings between heehaw comedy and wincing agony, the movie establishes its raised-eyebrow tone with a title card stating it’s “Based on irony-free, wildly contradictory and totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly,” her former husband. (The screenwriter, Steven Rogers, has said that he spoke with both.) From their separate corners, the middle-aged, long-divorced Tonya and Jeff (Sebastian Stan), provide linked, at times vividly contradictory accounts of what happened.
In one location, Jeff sits facing the camera in front of a large window framed by photo-covered walls. There’s a lot more visual coding going on with Tonya, who’s plunked down at a table in a modest kitchen wearing a pale jeans jacket and cowboy boots. Lank blond hair and bangs border her face; her neck has gone puffy. Looking into the camera, she occasionally draws on a cigarette and crosses her legs, one big, down-home, country-gal ankle resting on a knee. The real eye-catchers are the dirty dishes stacked in the sink behind her. They stay put and stay dirty, which seems curiously sloppy given that Tonya, a media veteran, is here to tell her truth. If you didn’t know she had a reputation as down-and-dirty, here’s a hint.
As Tonya and Jeff offer up alternating stories, her past, her abuse and her triumphs come into view. The only daughter of an unhappily married couple, the young Tonya is a daddy’s girl. Her father takes her hunting, teaching her how to shoot rabbit. Her awful mother, LaVona (Allison Janney, chilled and excellent), is the one who arranges for Tonya to take lessons with a skating coach (Julianne Nicholson). Tonya turns out to be a prodigy and is soon powering her way into the top echelon of the sport, despite the snobbery and visible discomfort of the judges who favor froufrou femininity over aggressive competition. They want gliding princesses, not grunting athletes like Tonya.
The story of Tonya Harding has been told before in mainstream journalism and in scholarly accounts, documentaries and a quickie made-for-TV movie that lathered the soap. Before and after the incident, as it’s often called, she was grist for thumb-sucking takes on women, femininity, sports and social class. Before the attack, writers liked to point out that Ms. Harding played pool and drove a truck. In a sympathetic 1992 profile, Sports Illustrated described her as a “hardscrabble, dispossessed kid” who had become “an interloper in the realm of pixies and queens who’s as at home doing a brake job as she is performing an arabesque.” She was Cinderella with edge and muscles.
In “I, Tonya,” she is also an unreliable narrator, just like Jeff. “There’s no such thing as truth,” Tonya announces. “Everyone has their own truth.” The film takes up this statement as its guiding narrative principle, toggling between the she-said and he-said as it hurdles toward its nadir. The older Tonya makes an assertion, and the older Jeff does likewise. The young Tonya — in flashback — says one thing, the young Jeff says something else, and every so often LaVona chimes in. Characters periodically break the fourth wall by looking into the camera and directly addressing the viewer, as if to assert ownership on the unwinding story. Listen to me, each seems to say in these moments.
Ms. Robbie takes on the role with vigor and strained toothy smiles, giving an outsize performance that suits the film’s broadness and showy surfaces. (She does much of her own skating, though the trickier moves were completed with stunt doubles and digital effects.) Despite the makeup and a few tragic haircuts, Ms. Robbie remains an unpersuasive fit for the tiny Ms. Harding, who could bench press more than her weight and whose sculptured muscles freaked some out. You could write a treatise on female bodies pegged to the contempt that journalists unloaded on her, especially after the attack, when they called her “white trash” and “old Thunder Thighs.” She was 23.
As “I, Tonya” skips here and there and thickens the plot, it becomes increasingly baffling why the filmmakers decided to put a comic spin on this pathetic, dispiriting story. No matter how hard the movie tries to coax out laughs, there’s little about Ms. Harding, her circumstances or her choices that skews as funny. She was poor, grew up in trailers, had a temper, liked loud colors, dropped out of school, traded in one abuser for another and maintained some stupid acquaintances — a clown posse the filmmakers lavish too much time on. She might have played a role in the attack on Ms. Kerrigan, but in many ways Ms. Harding had already been found guilty for just being who she was. The same feels true here.
“I, Tonya” asserts that the truth is elusive. Yet some facts are known. Ms. Harding — as was widely reported — took out restraining orders against Mr. Gillooly, telling the police that he had hit her and she was afraid of him. Back then, her abuse was often played down; here, it is countered by scenes in which the tough Tonya fights back, at times with a comedic spin, as if to suggest that she can give as good as she gets. That makes this film and the brutality more breezily watchable, I suppose. Still, it’s instructive that at one point Tonya lectures the audience on its complicity in how she was treated. It’s an impressively disingenuous wag of the finger from a film that has encouraged our laughter right from the start." 0.358217428 "Biography" "R" "Neon" "" "" "" "" "20" "25-Aug-88" "3-Nov-88" "" NA

Partly inspired by George Prochnik’s 2010 book of the same title, this elegant sermon by Patrick Shen on why we should dial down the racket of our daily lives will make you consider turning off and tuning out.
Gathering academics, audiologists and other experts who share his anticacophony view, Mr. Shen aims to show that excessive sound can negatively affect our bodies as well as our minds. His style is compare-and-contrast: rural versus urban, the natural world versus the electronic and synthetic. Tranquil scenes from an Iowa monastery and a national park give way jarringly to the metallic din in a subway station and the deafening clamor of a restaurant. A visit to Mumbai (believed to be the noisiest city in the world) will leave your ears ringing.
Shot over two years and in eight countries, the movie has a quirky lightness that prevents it from slipping into lecture. Its arguments range wide without going deep, but its factoids about the medical benefits of hanging out in a forest — and the cognitive costs of a noisy school or hospital — are fascinating and persuasive.
At times, the film’s insistence on linking the silent to the sacred can border on preachy. But then we check in with Greg Hindy, a stoic searcher who stopped talking for a year while he walked across the United States.

With the help of her longtime collaborator and co-writer, Peter Kjenaas, and the first-time director Taron Lexton, Ms. Cartwright creates a Felliniesque fantasy of her own.
In the movie, Lucy (Ksenia Solo) is a sheltered 20-year-old who inherited her mother’s idealistic view of romance and appreciation of feel-good movies. After her mother (Maria Bello) falls ill, Lucy finds solace at a festival of Fellini films and discovers movies with dark endings and sexual scenes that she had never seen before. She resolves to find the man of her cinematic dreams in Italy.
Lucy, whose wide-eyed naïveté is modeled after Giulietta Masina’s character in “La Strada,” isn’t the only reference to Fellini’s movies. “In Search of Fellini” is overflowing with characters, locations and visual cues to the director’s classics, like “La Dolce Vita,” “8 ½” and “Nights of Cabiria.” Fans who refer to Fellini as Il Maestro may delight in these references, but several cues and cameos are followed by a scene or poster of the cited movie, so as not to exclude the rest of the audience.
Fellini used nostalgia to point out something about ourselves; Mr. Lexton uses it to remind us of Fellini’s films.

The first two follow a pattern that will be familiar to “Law & Order” fans. A crime is investigated, and then a trial conducted, with a few twists and reversals on the way to the verdict. The emphasis, though, falls less on the procedural aspects of the case than its psychological effects, specifically on Katja Sekerci (Diane Kruger), a German woman whose husband and young son are killed in a bombing in Hamburg.
Mr. Akin, whose previous features include the explosive “Head-On” and the sprawling, wrenching political melodrama “The Edge of Heaven,” observes his characters and their social environment with a rigorously measured mix of intensity and detachment. Katja, in the days and weeks after the attack, spirals through stages of grief, shock and despair. Surrounded by relatives, friends and in-laws, and visited by pushy, polite detectives, she seems desperately, furiously alone. Because her husband, Nuri (Numan Akar), was a Turkish immigrant and a former drug dealer, the police raise the specters of Islamist terrorism and gang activity. Katja is adamant: “Nazis killed my husband.” She has the grim satisfaction of being right.
If the first section of “In the Fade” provides a series of snapshots of a contemporary German life — the hectic pleasures of its big cities; its ambivalent multiculturalism; its bureaucratic humanism — the second part zeros in on the gears of the country’s legal system. Subtlety gives way to blunter characterizations when the two main advocates spar in the courtroom. Katja’s interests are represented by an old friend (Denis Moschitto), who seems kind and conscientious. The accused murderers, a young married couple, are defended by a tall, bald, sarcastic lawyer (Johannes Krisch) who is perhaps a bit too transparently villainous.
But he does succeed in galvanizing the audience’s disgust, and in reframing the story as a conflict between the desire for justice and the drive for vengeance. This is a venerable theme in movies, driving the plots of most of westerns. In this instance, it carries an extra jolt of political relevance. How should liberal societies deal with homegrown political extremists, who seek protection from the democratic norms and institutions they are committed to destroying? How should the victims of far-right-wing violence fight back?
That last question brings about a startling change of scene and tone in the movie’s final section, which feels like a miniature film noir set in the incongruous sunshine of Greece. But just as “In the Fade” should be reaching its starkest, sharpest point, as Katja’s pain pushes her toward a moral crisis, Mr. Akin’s focus seems to waver, and the sense of tough existential clarity that is his greatest virtue goes blurry. The ending is puzzling, when it wants to be devastating, and the political and personal sides of the story, rather than illuminating each other, fight to a stalemate.
Ms. Kruger, however, who won the best actress award at Cannes in May, leaves a vivid, haunting impression. Katja, who has already traveled a path from wildness to domestic stability, struggles with the enforced passivity of violent bereavement. With her husband and son gone, the world is dislodged from its axis, and there is nothing Katja can do to set it right again. Dwelling in her sorrow is agonizing, but moving on might be even worse." 0.973188552 "Crime" "R" "Magnolia" "" "$10,455 " "" "" "20" "2-Oct-15" "" "210" 30

Matt Spicer’s debut feature introduces Ingrid (Aubrey Plaza) as an obsessive, dangerous app addict who crashes a wedding and pepper-sprays the bride, ostensibly for not inviting her. It turns out the bride wasn’t a friend, but merely encouraged Ingrid by commenting on one of her posts.
Ingrid’s next fixation is Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth Olsen), a social media gadfly. To get close to her, Ingrid moves to Los Angeles, visits a restaurant that Taylor has praised (repeating her order) and abducts Taylor’s dog as a pretext for returning it. As the two become besties, the movie makes the not-revelatory point that Taylor’s stage-managed life — including her dream of opening a boutique (“my Instagram, but in real life”) — is barely less fraudulent than Ingrid’s.
Ms. Plaza is a whiz with timing and does a deft job of shifting viewers’ sympathy; her character can be loathsome or pathetic depending on the scene. O’Shea Jackson Jr., as her Batman-obsessed landlord, is every bit as funny and nearly walks away with the movie. Still, Mr. Spicer cops out by going with the obvious ending.

"130" "It" "9/8/2017" "9/6/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/movies/it-review-stephen-king.html" 0 "Late in the summer of 1989, the marquee of the downtown movie theater in Derry, Me., advertises “A Nightmare on Elm Street 5.” This is an accurate period detail, and also a declaration of kinship, if not outright homage. “It,” Andy Muschietti’s adaptation of the novel by Stephen King, belongs in the same tradition of small-town terror as Wes Craven’s “Nightmare” franchise, though the question of influence has a certain chicken-and-egg quality. Pennywise the clown, the designated predator in “It,” (played by Bill Skarsgard) is, like Freddy Krueger, an avatar of deep childhood fears. And like Freddy, he’s also the literal, lethal manifestation of the evil of the world. As such, he has the potential to spawn endless sequels. He’ll be back.
Or rather, he is back. Mr. Muschietti’s “It,” written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman, represents a second trip to this particular well. Mr. King’s novel, published in 1986, was adapted for network television in 1990. The new movie, a skillful blend of nostalgic sentiment and hair-raising effects, with the visual punch of big-screen digital hocus-pocus and the liberties of the R rating, still has the soothing charm of familiarity. The gang of misfit ’80s kids who face down the clown and the deeper horror he represents evoke both the middle school posse of the recent TV series “Stranger Things” (there’s some overlap in the cast), but also the intrepid brotherhood from “Stand by Me,” surely one of the all-time top five Stephen King movie adaptations.
We can argue about the others — I’m happy to make a case for John Carpenter’s underrated “Christine” — but this “It” doesn’t quite ascend to their level. Nonetheless, the filmmakers honor both the pastoral and the infernal dimensions of Mr. King’s distinctive literary vision. Derry, with its redbrick storefronts and its quirks and kinks, seems like a genuinely nice place to live in spite of the fact that its citizens, children in particular, turn up missing or maimed at an alarming rate.
The supernatural nastiness embodied by Pennywise is abetted and to some extent camouflaged by the ordinary human awfulness that also afflicts Derry. In addition to menacing clowns, phantasmatic lepers and spooky paintings come to life, the town is home to an ugly assortment of bullies (the worst one played by Nicholas Hamilton), gossips and abusive parents.
Against these forces — the banal and the diabolical alike — “It” assembles a squad of early and preadolescent ghostbusters as varied as an infantry platoon in a World War II combat picture. The leader is Bill (Jaeden Lieberher), a melancholy, thoughtful boy whose little brother, Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott), has been spirited down a storm sewer by Pennywise. Bill’s comrades — they call themselves the Losers’ Club — include a nerdy chatterbox (Finn Wolfhard) and a germ-phobic mama’s boy (Jack Dylan Grazer), plus a Jewish kid (Wyatt Oleff), a black kid (Chosen Jacobs) and a new kid (Jeremy Ray Taylor). Also a girl, Bev (Sophia Lillis), who becomes part of a sweet, alliterative romantic triangle involving Bill and the new kid, whose name is Ben.
Like many real kids — even in 1989, even in Maine — they have filthy mouths. They also experience the freedom and peril of growing up in the days before cellphones, bicycle helmets and helicopter parenting. What’s scary about “It,” for them and for the audience, is also fun. The group ranges freely through the forests and fields around Derry, playing detective until the forces of darkness stand revealed with slimy tentacles and multiple rows of sharp, ravenous teeth.
That isn’t a spoiler, but it’s a bit of paradox. The non-clown essence of It, an H.R. Gigeresque vagina dentata type of deal, is far less scary than Pennywise, with his fluting voice and red balloons, and the other specters that seem to spring from tender young psyches. As creature design has become easier and more elaborate, thanks to digital techniques, it has also become less imaginative. Movie monsters resemble one another more and more, and movies of distinct genres feel increasingly trapped within the expected. The climactic sequence of “It” sacrifices horror-movie creepiness for action-movie bombast, staging a big fight in a cavernous space. We might as well be looking at superheroes.
That we aren’t comes as a relief. The young cast is consistently good company, in particular the Ben-Bill-Bev trio. Ms. Lillis earns the Molly Ringwald reference that mischievously pops up in the script as a wink to those in the audience who still remember the ’80s.

This documentary takes us into the mind and body of a young Irish filmmaker, Simon Fitzmaurice, who wakes each morning closer to total paralysis.
Speaking in the first person, the actor Colin Farrell narrates Mr. Fitzmaurice’s story as he struggles to pursue his career while losing his body to the neurodegenerative disease A.L.S., or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Frankie Fenton directed this film, which borrows from Mr. Fitzmaurice’s memoir of the same title and makes liberal use of boisterous and tender home videos of his family that also document the last time Mr. Fitzmaurice danced or walked.
Perhaps the most striking aspect of the film is the shocking rapidity of his decline. Once his diagnosis becomes clear, when he is 34, doctors predict Mr. Fitzmaurice will live three to four years, but he soars past that (he is now 42) and remains amazingly productive, working painstakingly on his first feature film, “My Name Is Emily,” released this year.
By the time shooting begins on that film, Mr. Fitzmaurice is using a ventilator to breathe. He directs the actors through his only means of communication: eye-gaze technology. His computer decodes his gaze and speaks for him in a robotic voice, which his wife charmingly refers to as “American.”

Instead this documentary serves as a feature-length advertisement for the artist, and is about as daring as a billboard for skim milk.
Surveying Mr. Schnabel’s life from his boyhood through his success in the art world and as a film director, the movie includes interviews with family members who pile on the adulations from the first minutes to the final scenes. Jeff Koons, Bono, Al Pacino and other celebrities also check in to extol Mr. Schnabel’s brilliance.
All that tell and no show. Interviews with Mr. Schnabel reveal few interesting points, while a grating soundtrack telegraphs how it thinks you should be feeling. Worse still, there’s far too little art. The pieces shown, many of them beguiling, practically beg for their close-ups and for some exploration.
Instead, Pappi Corsicato, the director and a friend of Mr. Schnabel’s, hurries back to the fawn fest; there’s also scant mention of the controversies that have arisen during, and are now inseparable from, Mr. Schnabel’s career. It’s somehow perverse that an artist this prime for discussion is given nothing but monotonous praise, while his work is treated as an afterthought.
In an interview for the publicity notes, Mr. Schnabel called the film “very useful, helpful and informative,” a phrase that seems more fitting to describe a computer’s user manual. Like a manual, this film appears incapable of conveying any genuine joy or anger or excitement, offering only words that sound a lot alike.

The movie opens in 1996 with a young man finding the now-discarded board game that wreaked such havoc on its players in the 1995 Robin Williams movie. The game winds up in the room of a teenager who ignores it, because who wants to play a board game? Overnight, the board game magically turns into a video game cartridge. And upon being inserted into the teen’s console, something strange happens.
The movie cuts to the present day and introduces four archetypal, irritating teen characters. There’s the smart and awkward Spencer; his former best friend “Fridge,” now a high school football star who makes Spencer do his homework; the selfie-obsessed popular girl, Bethany; and Martha, who’s a diluted variation of Allison, the smartest and angriest girl in the room in “The Breakfast Club.” And much like in that movie, these kids all get detention together.
At first, I presumed that the film’s increased attention on these teenagers was to make us that much more eager for the stars Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black to show up. There’s good news and bad news: We meet the marquee names shortly after detention. Only they are portraying those same irritating teen characters.
I’ll explain. The actual teens discover the discarded video game console in the detention room. They plug it in, the game boots up, and the kids choose their characters. Then they get sucked into the game, where they, among other things, meet the fellow who got sucked into the game 20 years before.
The movie derives its humor, such as it is, from the teens’ avatar choices. The nerd gets to be Dwayne Johnson. The big football player gets to be Kevin Hart (who, it is frequently noted, is not tall). The shy, awkward Martha gets to be an expert in dance-fighting (played by Karen Gillan). And the selfie-obsessed girl gets to be, surprise, Jack Black. The crew must navigate a mission that involves a large gem and a villain (Bobby Cannavale) who has insects crawling in and out of his mouth more regularly than is considered normal.
Their adventure often asks, “What would Steven Spielberg do?” It then answers poorly. (The movie’s director, Jake Kasdan, happens to be the son of Lawrence Kasdan, who worked as a screenwriter with Mr. Spielberg on “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”) The performances by Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hart and Mr. Black seem informed by the conviction that if they amuse themselves, they will also amuse others. They are not entirely wrong, but they are also not sufficiently right. Ms. Gillan, the lesser-known quantity of the group, has to work harder as the geeky teen comes to enjoy living, even if temporarily, in a bombshell adult package. She does commendable work both satirizing, and also fulfilling, a sexist conception." 0.515885392 "Action" "PG-13" "Sony / Columbia" "$90,000,000 " "$36,169,328 " "" "" "1,731" "25-Dec-97" "" "" NA

In last year’s magical “Swiss Army Man,” he played a gassy, much-manhandled corpse; now he’s embracing the muck and mortifications of “Jungle,” a real-life survival tale from the Australian horror specialist Greg McLean.
To play the Israeli adventurer Yossi Ghinsberg, Mr. Radcliffe dives into water and quicksand, slathers himself in fire ants, tangles with a snake and excavates a parasite from his forehead. Given that these torments are very much in his director’s wheelhouse, it’s no surprise that they have an energy the rest of the movie (based on Mr. Ghinsberg’s 2005 memoir) lacks.
Yet the look is polished and the setup promising as Yossi heads into the Bolivian jungle with two backpacking pals, an American photographer (Alex Russell) and a Swiss teacher (Joel Jackson). Their guide is Karl (Thomas Kretschmann), a sketchy stranger whose possibly menacing motives cry out for an investigation — fictionalized, if necessary — that never comes. Similarly, Yossi’s friends remain essentially enigmas, generic sidekicks without much to distinguish them beyond degrees of daring and propensity for bickering.
Slow to get moving and dramatically slack, “Jungle” cares only about Yossi, whose solo suffering and speed-enhanced hallucinations dominate the narrative. Despite Mr. Radcliffe’s all-too-obvious dedication (his increasingly emaciated body, astonishingly, was not digitally enhanced), he can’t rescue a screenplay (by Justin Monjo) that cares more about the condition of his flesh than the contents of his head." 0.056559415 "Action" "Unrated" "Eros" "" "$1,225 " "" "$32,869 " "3" "9-Apr-04" "" "161" 23

This isn’t even the first time two guys have battled for Ms. Russo’s favor in a film written and directed by Ron Shelton.
The humor is self-defeating, though, since this wheezy romantic caper — with Tommy Lee Jones and Morgan Freeman as the rival suitors — inspires little more than melancholy reminiscences of Mr. Shelton’s earlier work. Male competition, in sports and romance, has been his chief interest as a screenwriter and a filmmaker, and it has yielded some pretty good work over the years. “Bull Durham” and “White Men Can’t Jump,” most memorably, but also underrated entertainments like “Tin Cup” (in which Ms. Russo was the prize sought by Kevin Costner and Don Johnson) and “Hollywood Homicide,” which hold up better than you might expect.
This one should be better than it is. There were no advance screenings for critics — never a promising sign — but I bought a ticket and sat in a Manhattan theater with a half-dozen other oddballs over the weekend and a flicker of hope in my heart. The cast includes, in addition to the three points of the romantic triangle mentioned above, such fine comic and character performers as George Wallace, Joe Pantoliano, Elizabeth Ashley and Jane Seymour. Johnny Mathis is in it, too! How dire could it be?
Plenty dire, and not in a way that’s any fun to contemplate. The premise has some farcical potential. Mr. Freeman is Duke Diver, the manager of a Palm Springs retirement community with some unsavory secrets in his past. Someone is trying to kill him, but that’s the least of his troubles. The big one is the arrival of Leo McKay, a Texas big shot with a military background and a hidden agenda. He parks his pickup truck in Duke’s designated spot, wins Duke’s money in a poker game and moves in on Duke’s trio of friends with benefits (Glenne Headly, Ms. Ashley and Sheryl Lee Ralph). And then Suzie Quince (Ms. Russo) shows up to audit Duke’s books and accelerate the plot.
Which sadly does not happen. In spite of the charm and discipline of the stars, the jokes misfire and the scenes creak and stumble. That it all takes place around Christmas time in the desert just makes everything sadder. “Just Getting Started,” which should skip and sprint, feels slow and interminable, as if someone were reciting the plot of a Ron Shelton movie he or she had seen once on a plane.

The bar could scarcely have been lower given that the previous movie, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” was such an interminable slog. The superhero and villain dynamic is much the same (slayers going to slay, etc.), but there are a few fresh faces now and Wonder Woman has more to do than play backup. The story is a confusion of noise, visual clutter and murderous digital gnats, but every so often a glimmer of life flickers through.
The last time he fronted a movie, Superman (Henry Cavill) seemed to die, a plot twist that not even the most credulous viewer could buy. So, of course he’s back in this one, eventually, although first the band needs to get together. Having seen trouble on the horizon, Batman, a.k.a. Bruce Wayne — played with a sepulchral growl and bespoke stubble by Ben Affleck — takes the lead on this enterprise. He’s the insistent manager as well as the scowling host, the guy with the cool digs, smooth rides with blinking screens (“critical damage” reads one with great comic-book sincerity) and suave butler (Jeremy Irons as Alfred). He’s also pretty much of a yawn.
The pumped-up Mr. Affleck again fills out the bat suit from ripped stem to stern, but his costume remains grievously larger than Batman’s (or Bruce’s) personality. Bat-Bruce clearly has some kind of unrequited thing for Wonder Woman, a.k.a. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot, a charming super-presence), which leads him to stammer like a teenager. (She’s got other things on her mind.) He has money and a modest sense of humor, including about his wealth, which inspires one of the movie’s few decent laughs. Mr. Affleck, a generally appealing actor who can plumb the depths when pushed (“Gone Girl”), needs something more substantial (or just more jokes) if his Batman is ever going to work.
As it is, the little bit of bat brooding in “Justice League” feels unmotivated and unearned, and lacks the shading of the character in the “Dark Knight” or even in the Lego movies. That’s too bad, and would be dire if he played a more valuable role. But “Justice League” is about solidarity rather than flying and soaring solo, so the movie spends considerable time piecing together its newest parts: the Flash, a.k.a. Barry Allen (Ezra Miller), a zippy wisenheimer wreathed in lightning; Aquaman, a.k.a. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), an underwater tough with a chest full of muscles and tattoos; and Cyborg, a.k.a. Victor Stone (Ray Fisher), a machine man built from metal and serious attitude.
The original Justice League of America (as it was called) first convened in 1960; the movie takes place in the present or at least a facsimile of the same. The world is in mourning for Superman, and so is Lois Lane (Amy Adams, shedding tears and largely wasted). Everything is about to get worse, because of course it has to, leading Bat-Bruce and Wonder-Diana to round up a troika that was teased earlier. Some of the best scenes in the movie are of the introductions to these three newcomers, who step up beauty pageant-style to fill in some back story — one has roots in Atlantis, the other two are from hard-luck city — while flexing individual quirks and superpowers.
“Justice League” settles into a groove once it finds its gang. As Bat-Bruce moodily pushes and prods and Wonder-Diana smiles and smirks, the newbies jockey for position. The Flash gets most of the best jokes, and Mr. Miller makes most of them work, largely in the role of in-house fanboy with a touch of the Cowardly Lion. It’s golly-gee stuff, but it’s also human and Mr. Miller keeps you hooked, as does Mr. Momoa (“Game of Thrones”), who supplely shifts between gravitas and comedy. When Aquaman chugs a bottle of booze before plunging into an angry sea, the movie hits the comic-book sweet spot between deadly seriousness and self-amused levity.
Cyborg isn’t as buoyant a presence, which makes sense for a character who’s been partly cobbled together from scraps and a sob story that Mr. Fisher puts across with bowed head and palpable heaviness. The hoodie he sometimes wears, which can’t help but evoke Trayvon Martin, imparts a larger meaning that the movie doesn’t or can’t explore. Like the references to a coming world catastrophe that suggestively shudders with wider implications, the hoodie suggests filmmakers who are still struggling to keep an eye on the offscreen world while spinning a fictional universe that can somehow offer a brief escape from it.
Mr. Snyder remains regrettably committed to a dark, desaturated palette that borders on the murky, and this movie’s chaotic, unimaginative action scenes can drag on forever. But the touches of humor in “Justice League” lighten the whole thing tonally and are a relief after the dirgelike “Batman v Superman,” which he ran into the ground with a two-and-a-half-hour running time. (“Justice League” clocks in at a not-exactly fleet two hours.) Written by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon, the new movie shows a series that’s still finding its footing as well as characters who, though perhaps not yet as ostensibly multidimensional as Marvel’s, may be more enduring (and golden). It has justice, and it has banter. And while it could have used more hanging out, more breeziness, it is a start." 0.364748352 "Action" "PG-13" "Warner Bros."

The volumes currently crowding bookstore front tables — George Orwell’s “1984,” Sinclair Lewis’s “It Can’t Happen Here,” Hannah Arendt’s “The Origins of Totalitarianism” — offer time-tested prophecies and autopsies of dictatorship. “Karl Marx City” supplements their theories and speculations with everyday facts about life in the supposed workers’ paradise of the German Democratic Republic.
Ms. Epperlein grew up there, in the city once (and once again) known as Chemnitz, which East Germany rulers renamed after the father of their ideology. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany (as the Communists were officially known) conceived Karl-Marx-Stadt as a showcase of productivity and prosperity, an industrial powerhouse devoted to the supremacy of the East German proletariat.
After the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Ms. Epperlein made her way to the West. She and Mr. Tucker, an American-born filmmaker, together made a series of tough-minded, intellectually curious shorts and features, including “Gunner Palace” (2005), one of the first documentaries about the Iraq War and still one of the best.
In “Karl Marx City,” she steps in front of the camera and returns to her hometown, excavating the zone where family and national history intersect. Accompanied by a third-person voice-over narration — she is not “I” but “she” in her own story — Ms. Epperlein interviews her mother and brothers, historians and archivists, members of the Stasi and their victims.
That isn’t always an obvious distinction. The Stasi security service deployed hundreds of thousands of East German citizens as spies and informants, creating a climate of near-total surveillance and pervasive paranoia. Stasi agents routinely collected information from colleagues and neighbors, and broke into apartments in search of incriminating evidence. What they usually found, according to one former officer, were hand-copied West German television schedules and overnight bags packed in anticipation of flight or arrest.
Ms. Epperlein conducts her inquiry armed with a giant, fuzz-covered microphone and adorned with a pair of heavy black headphones. This equipment looks a bit comical, but its presence is as much a declaration of ethical principles as an arresting visual joke. The Stasi took pictures and made recordings in secret; its surveillance was stealthy, invisible. Ms. Epperlein — who with her cropped blond hair and regal bearing resembles Robin Wright in “House of Cards” — becomes a walking emblem of honesty and transparency, an embodiment of the documentary ideal.
In addition to illuminating the inner workings of everyday political terror, she tries to shed light on a family tragedy. In 1999, 10 years after the collapse of East German communism, Ms. Epperlein’s father committed suicide. Fifteen years after that, his only daughter forces herself to confront the awful possibility that he might have collaborated with the Stasi. So many people did.
The mystery of her father’s life and death provides “Karl Marx City” with suspense, and with a concrete sense of profound moral and emotional stakes. Repressive regimes excel at creating ambiguity, at making complicity easier than resistance and at blurring the lines between heroes and villains. Ms. Epperlein and Mr. Tucker, shooting in black and white and making judicious use of historical footage, brilliantly evoke a landscape of gray areas. They also uncover glimmers of decency, loyalty and solidarity — the tiny cracks in the totalitarian edifice that foretold its eventual and inevitable collapse." 0.995638419 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Bond/360" "" "$29,175 " "$68,945 " "$14,278,720 " "441" "30-Mar-01" "" "" NA

Cats, for instance, would keep rodents away from granaries. They were cared for by humans, but not coddled, maintaining a certain measure of independence. The street cats of Istanbul, who would probably be considered an animal-control problem in the United States, are, in a sense, throwbacks to those ancients.
“Kedi” (“Feline”), a frequently enchanting documentary directed by Ceyda Torun, showcases some of these feline personalities and the humans who look after them. There’s a good deal of projection in the verbal accounts of the animals’ lives, but the movie, with its mobile camera low to the ground or looking down at cat-navigated rooftops, doesn’t do much to contradict the indirect anthropomorphizing. There’s a lot of action at piers and fish markets.
One restaurant cat earns its love old-school style, by snaring vermin. Another is so meek (or haughty, depending on how you look at it) that it never enters the high-end delicatessen it’s made its home, but signals frantically at the window when it’s hungry. The movie is replete with ingeniously constructed mini-narratives, including a turf war. The mesmerizing score by Kira Fontana, interspersed with well-chosen Turkish pop, is a real asset.
The movie hits a somber note near the end, noting that Istanbul’s modernization is crowding out both individuated neighborhoods and cats. The animals, one human says, can “rekindle our own slowly dying love of life.” That’s one way of putting it, I guess. In any event, I give “Kedi” four claws up." 0.942147948 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Oscilloscope Pictures" "" "$40,103 " "$2,835,047 " "" "1" "7-Nov-03" "28-Apr-04" "133" 19

But to hear the former far-right Hungarian politician Csanad Szegedi tell it, he was essentially a self-taught anti-Semite. In “Keep Quiet,” a documentary directed by Sam Blair and Joseph Martin, Mr. Szegedi recalls the pride he felt as a student reading far-right newspapers pushing a nationalist narrative.
Anne Applebaum, a historian and columnist for The Washington Post, notes in the film that Hungary “is a part of the world where history has been manipulated.” Using video footage from the early 2000s to track Mr. Szegedi’s rise to the vice presidency of the nationalist Jobbik party, the film shows a TV ad in which the Jobbik platform is put forth: “Protect Hungarian lands! Restore law and order! Multinationals must pay taxes! To jail with the culprits! Because Hungary belongs to the Hungarians!” For his part, Mr. Szegedi disdains what he calls “cosmopolitan” Jews who insist “all Hungary gave the world was peach schnapps and baggy pants.”
Then Mr. Szegedi learns an inconvenient truth: He is of Jewish lineage. His grandmother was an Auschwitz survivor. His colleagues initially suggest that this could be a good thing, inoculating the party from accusations of race hate. That strategy seems to last about half a minute, and Mr. Szegedi is expelled. He begins to embrace his Jewish identity, perhaps out of necessity. “Why didn’t you stop me?” he asks his family about his political activity. Even if you are unmoved by Mr. Szegedi’s personal story (I found him somewhat sympathetic), what “Keep Quiet” tells us about its larger themes is upsettingly pertinent." 0.410216193 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Kino Lorber" "$3,000,000 " "$7,624 " "$26,904 " "$21,158,323 " "2,976" "17-Nov-17" "" "91" 13

Karla panics during a call to her lawyer — her ex has a girlfriend and a business, and she’s only a waitress. But when Frankie is kidnapped while playing at a park, the meek Karla is unleashed as the vigilante Valkyrie of the Interstate highways, promising herself and Frankie’s backwoods abductors through car accidents and police interference: “As long as my son is in that car, I will not stop. Wherever you go, I will be right behind you.”
It’s sometimes funny to watch Ms. Berry act out scenes of Karla’s frenzy — running at full speed with a limp, gingerly approaching a kidnapper’s lair with a gun she’s never used. But as a producer of the movie as well as its star, she approaches the task of playing this unhinged mother on the run with sincerity.
The director, Luis Prieto, doesn’t waste time trying to build an arc to Karla’s desperation. Her adrenaline kicks in the moment she sees Frankie being shoved into the back seat of an unfamiliar Mustang, and it doesn’t dip until the credits roll. Cars crash, Karla rises. Guns fire, Karla slashes. The greatest strength of “Kidnap” is that it casts the maternal instinct as a primordial will to enact violence, to drag a man from a moving van, to beat a kidnapper with a shovel.

And, well, why should it be or how could it be, given who’s behind the camera? The director Guy Ritchie likes his action fast and frenetic, and he’s more focused on how things look — mostly, he’s chasing that certain something called cool — than in narrative coherency or plausibility. And, anyway, those angry elephants are magical, just like the dragons swooping through the HBO show “Game of Thrones.”
It’s hard not to attribute the existence of this new Arthurian tale in part to the global success of “Game of Thrones,” which has hooked legions on its epic soap opera, clashing swords, spurting blood and unending intrigue. (That show’s Aidan Gillen pops up here too.) The Arthur story has played out differently across the centuries, from the Middle Ages to T. H. White’s novel “The Sword in the Stone” to Disney’s 20th-century cartoon take, and each moment in time shapes the way it’s told. In this case, that means something old, something blockbustery and that Guy Ritchie je ne sais quoi.
Put differently, this variation on the Arthurian legend fleetingly brings to mind “Game of Thrones” but mostly plays out according to the Ritchie template: a self-amused, endlessly resourceful laddish hero gets in and out of trouble with winks, smarts and brute force, sometimes in the company of Jude Law. This time the resident rogue is Arthur, played with easy, low-wattage charisma by Charlie Hunnam, who has a gift for delivering nonsense without seeming embarrassed. Mr. Law, who played Watson in Mr. Ritchie’s “Sherlock” flicks, takes on mustache-twirling duties as Vortigern, a louche pouter who skulks around in black, doubtless dreaming of Richard III.
Arthur and Vortigern mix it up amid a lot of shenanigans, detours and filler, some bad, some good and all of it disposable. Written by Mr. Ritchie, Joby Harold and Lionel Wigram, the movie is mostly about establishing Arthur’s origin story, which turns on the usual reluctant hero coming to terms with his destiny, meaning Dad (Eric Bana) and Dad’s mighty sword. This lineage and its burdens take a while to work through, primarily because this movie plays like the first installment in a hoped-for series. Merlin scarcely makes the scene, and Guinevere and Lancelot have yet to arrive to stir up trouble.
The opener is a clotted visual mess, which isn’t surprising. But it is disappointing just because the whole thing — the landscape, castle and so forth — is so drearily fake and ugly, even if the elephants are kind of amusing and it’s always nice to see Mr. Bana. The movie improves once Mr. Ritchie moves closer to his actors, a pleasantly diverting crew that includes Djimon Hounsou as a fixer extraordinaire and Astrid Bergès-Frisbey as a witchy woman of some type. They help sell the generic goods — basically, a band of merry, dirty dozen (or so) smarty-pants renegades giving it to the Man — and the results are easy enough to watch, especially if, like Mr. Hunnam, you don’t embarrass easily." 0.613898361 "Action" "PG-13" "Warner Bros."

Like its 2015 predecessor, this latest visit with the British agents-cum-Savile Row tailors swings for the fences without caring whose head — or torso, or dignity — is shredded en route. Even if it belongs to Sir Elton.
In a plot as sloppy and extended as over-washed elastic, the singer’s cameo as the feathered-and-sequined pet of a drug-dealing villain named Poppy (Julianne Moore) is a ludicrous highlight. A homesick sociopath, Poppy has styled her Cambodian lair to resemble Eisenhower-era America, including a diner where those who displease her are churned into Hamburger Helper. (So that’s what the first film was lacking: cannibalism.)
Bigger, longer and — at an interminable 141 minutes — apparently uncut, “Circle” is an emotionally sterile lark, its wounds inflicted with brolly and bullwhip, a smirk and a shrug. Obliterating all but two Kingsmen in the opening reel, the story (by the director, Matthew Vaughn, and Jane Goldman) forces the leftovers into the protective arms of their American counterparts, cowboy spies with rolling hips and code names like Tequila and Champagne. Their presence, led by a strutting Channing Tatum, lends the action a homoerotic glaze that I choose to believe is intentional.
Yet in a movie as happy to resurrect characters as rub them out, nothing is of consequence, and the glibness grows numbing.

After years in storage, the mighty ape with the big teeth and the thing for pale blondes has been dusted off and digitally turbocharged for “Kong: Skull Island.” Once again, a lot of the noise and action involve guns, monsters and crashing jungle chases, but the most promising moments involve King Kong and the really little lady he unexpectedly meets. In the past, their brief encounter made for some strange moments, none weirder than in the original 1933 film when Kong pauses while undressing his human doll to smell his fingers.
It was beauty that killed the beast, or so it has been repeatedly claimed. In 1933 it was Fay Wray’s scantily clad beauty who took the rap for bringing Kong down off the top of the Empire State Building. (Fighter planes with machines guns helped.) By 1976, the beauty-beast relationship had grown rather more complicated, and Jessica Lange was weepily begging Kong to hold onto her. In the 2005 redo it was Naomi Watts’s turn to shed tears for him. In “Kong: Skull Island,” the big guy has a new look and a new gal pal, Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), who’s somewhat feistier and certainly more sensibly dressed than her predecessors. She points and she shoots, and not just her camera.
“Skull Island” pretty much exhumes the same story conceived for the 1933 classic. This time, the adventurers include a group of government-backed scientists run by Bill Randa (John Goodman), who has his glinting eyes on a mysterious, seemingly unexplored island. Mysteries were made for solving, and this island, Randa reasons, may contain all manner of wonders, or perhaps something beyond human imagining. So, with a military unit led by Lt. Col. Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), the scientists ship out, accompanied by Mason, a no-nonsense war photographer who’s soon trading barbs and looks with the world’s prettiest mercenary, James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston).
The filmmakers fold a lot of moody detail into the introductions, including real locations and the fog of war: The story takes place in 1973 and the movie was primarily shot in Vietnam. (It was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts from a script by Dan Gilroy, Max Borenstein and Derek Connolly.) If the sweat, bantering grunts and teeming bars feel borrowed from innumerable other movies, they are also mostly on hand to get the story up and the characters running, which happens once the travelers pierce the thick clouds surrounding Skull Island. There, they meet the enemy and the enemy is — surprise — us, although there are plenty of digital terrors red in tooth and claw.
Over the years, critics have pushed and pulled at “King Kong,” denouncing its representation of the islanders (played by black actors in the 1933 film) and reading it metaphorically through black masculinity and white femininity. Later Kong movies have tried to sidestep criticism by changing the representation of the islanders while leaving beauty and the beast intact. Yet even as “Skull Island” avoids some stereotypes, it embraces others, partly through a struggle that pits a pathological black character against a pair of white saviors. Kong, meanwhile, at times feels sidelined, brought out every so often to wreak havoc and briefly exchange soulful looks with Mason.
“Skull Island” has momentum, polish and behemoths that slither and thunder. The sets and creature designs are often beautifully filigreed, but the larger picture remains murky. Backed by government and guns, the scientists prove to be colonialists by another name, an idea that the filmmakers bat around a bit, including in allusions to Joseph Conrad’s novella “Heart of Darkness.” These references pad “Skull Island,” giving audiences (and critics) something to chew on and help explain the repeated, near-fetishistic nods to “Apocalypse Now,” Francis Ford Coppola’s 1979 Vietnam-era retelling of the Conrad novel: the fireball sun, the military helicopters in formation and even a napalm attack.
If that weren’t enough, there’s also a Dennis Hopper-like character right out of “Apocalypse Now,” a loopy, grizzled survivor named Hank Marlow who is played by John C. Reilly in charming crazy mode (the narrator in “Heart of Darkness is also a Marlow). Marlow pops up after Kong makes his star entrance swatting down helicopters and scattering survivors. Far larger than his forebears, Kong looks as big as a mountain here. Supersizing is a default mode of the contemporary blockbuster, but in this case a pumped-up Kong may have something to do with his role in an evolving studio franchise featuring monsters (a.k.a. MonsterVerse) that kicked off with the 2014 “Godzilla.”
If all goes according to corporate plan, Kong will be slugging it out with Godzilla soon enough. That doubtless excites studio executives and some fans, but the promise of a return engagement drains much of the pathos from Kong. In many ways “Skull Island” looks and plays like its antecedents, despite the cosmetic tweaks, digital effects and attempts at inclusive casting. Like those earlier films, it too asks the critical question in many such tales — “Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the most monstrous of them all?” — through an ape who, because he’s a close relative, turns our gaze back on ourselves. Kong is the beast we know, the beast we deny, the beast we fear, the beast we kill.
Here, though, Kong is no longer the beast we love, the tragic captor-swain who, if he didn’t always win the affections of his prisoners, achieved immortality by seducing viewers. “Skull Island” is adept at goosing you; it deploys action-movie feints and horror-film frights capably amid its clichés and deaths. Every so often it also pauses and allows Kong and Mason to move you. As each recognizes the other, they bridge the divide, but perhaps because their relationship is more empathetic than romantic, these encounters don’t have the resonance they should. Alas, beauty no longer has her beast, the beast no longer has his beauty and this darkness has no heart even if it will have a sequel." 0.991088905 "Action" "PG-13" "Warner Bros."

But he does not wield a whip nor wear a fedora nor, for that matter, display the vigor of a young Harrison Ford or a young Jackie Chan.
Here he plays Jack Chan, a professor of antiquities in China, who leads students as well as his martial-arts-trained nephew (Aarif Rahman, performing much of the fisticuffs) in a treasure hunt that takes them to the China-India border (Iceland stands in); Dubai; and Jaipur, India. Also seeking the ancient riches, for sympathetic ends, is a gorgeous South Asian yoga practitioner (Disha Patani), and, for evil ones, an Indian patrician (Sonu Sood). Snakes, in “Indiana Jones” style, play an occasional supporting role.
Despite its subtext about the economic rivalry between China and India, the film, written and directed by Mr. Chan’s frequent collaborator Stanley Tong (“Supercop,” “Rumble in the Bronx”), mostly affords Mr. Chan the opportunity to mug, share a car chase scene with a lion (seemingly with a digital assist) and thwart assailants in a pallid variation on his acrobatics of old.

"145" "Lady Bird" "11/3/2017" "10/31/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/movies/lady-bird-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan.html" 1 "Christine McPherson, who prefers to be called Lady Bird — it’s her given name, she insists, in the sense that “it’s given to me, by me” — is a senior at a Catholic girls’ high school. Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith), the principal, has read Lady Bird’s college application essay. “It’s clear how much you love Sacramento,” Sister Sarah remarks. This comes as a surprise, both to Lady Bird and the viewer, who is by now aware of Lady Bird’s frustration with her hometown.
“I guess I pay attention,” she says, not wanting to be contrary.
“Don’t you think they’re the same thing?” the wise sister asks.
The idea that attention is a form of love (and vice versa) is a beautiful insight, and in many ways it’s the key to “Lady Bird,” Greta Gerwig’s beautiful, insightful new film, the first for which she is solely credited as writer and director. Ms. Gerwig, a Sacramento native and member of her heroine’s generation — the movie takes place mostly during the 2002-3 academic year — knows her characters and their world very well. Her affection envelops them like a secular form of grace: not uncritically, but unconditionally. And if you pay the right kind of attention to “Lady Bird” — absorbing its riffs and digressions as well as its melodies, its choral passages along with its solos and duets — you will almost certainly love it. It’s hard not to.
Lady Bird herself may be a bit more of a challenge. Played with daunting, dauntless precision by Saoirse Ronan (already, at 23, one of the most formidable actors in movies today), Lady Bird can give herself and everyone around her a hard time. Not because she is especially reckless or troubled — “Lady Bird” is the farthest thing from a melodrama of youth gone wild — but because she insists on asserting her own individuality, even when she’s not quite sure what that means.
She tackles the practical and spiritual project of becoming who she is with the mixture of self-assurance and insecurity common to adolescents of a certain sensitive kind. She is idealistic and hypocritical; self-centered and generous; a rebel and a conformist; an enthusiast and a skeptic. A typical American teenager, but also — and therefore — a unique bundle of contradictory and confusing impulses.
“I want you to be the very best version of yourself,” says her judgmental, habitually disappointed mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf).
“But what if this is the best version?” Lady Bird responds. It’s a sharp, sardonic line (one of many) and also an anguished existential question.
Christine (to use the name Marion gave her) wants to satisfy her mother, which is a difficult task because the standards seem impossibly high and subject to change without notice. She also wants to be true to her own desires and convictions, which is difficult for other reasons.
While “Lady Bird” honors the gravity of Christine’s struggle, it hardly neglects the everyday absurdity of her plight. The very first scene begins in tears. Mother and daughter, listening to an audiobook of “The Grapes of Wrath” while driving home from a college tour, cry over the novel’s moving final sentences. Their shared moment of literary catharsis quickly devolves into an argument, which is punctuated by a startling and hilarious jolt of physical comedy (one of many).
In tone and structure, after all, this is a teenage comedy. It finds humor in the eternally renewable cycle of senior year: homecoming and prom; math tests and school plays; the agonizing stages of the “admissions process.” Along the way, Christine undergoes other, extracurricular rites of passage. She falls in love for the first time and has sex for the first time. She trades in her loyal, longtime best friend (Beanie Feldstein) for a richer, more popular girl (Odeya Rush). She fights with her mother and her older brother, Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues), and leans on her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), an affable fellow with troubles of his own.
You might think you’ve seen this all before. You probably have, but never quite like this. What Ms. Gerwig has done — and it’s by no means a small accomplishment — is to infuse one of the most convention-bound, rose-colored genres in American cinema with freshness and surprise. The characters can look like familiar figures: the sad dad and the disapproving mom; the sullen brother and his goth girlfriend (Marielle Scott); the mean girls and the cool teachers; the too-perfect boyfriend (Lucas Hedges) and the dirtbag boyfriend (Timothée Chalamet). None of them are caricatures, though, and while everyone is mocked, nobody is treated with cruelty or contempt, at least by Ms. Gerwig. (Lady Bird is not always so kind.)
The script is exceptionally well-written, full of wordplay and lively argument. Every line sounds like something a person might actually say, which means that the movie is also exceptionally well acted. It is not too quick to soothe the abrasions of class and family. The McPhersons are hardly poor, but the daily toll of holding onto the ragged middle of the middle class is evident in Larry’s melancholy and Marion’s ill humor. They are a loving family, but their steadfast devotion to one another doesn’t always express itself as kindness. They are real people, honestly portrayed.
That might make “Lady Bird” sound drab and dutiful, but it’s the opposite. I wish I could convey to you just how thrilling this movie is. I wish I could quote all of the jokes and recount the best offbeat bits. I’d tell you about the sad priest and the football coach, about the communion wafers and the Sacramento real estate, about the sly, jaunty editing rhythms, the oddly apt music choices and the way Ms. Ronan drops down on the grass in front of her house when she receives an important piece of mail. I’m tempted to catalog the six different ways the ending can make you cry.
I’ll settle for one: the bittersweet feeling of having watched someone grow in front of your eyes, into a different and in some ways improved version of herself. In life, that’s a messy, endless process, which is one reason we need movies. Or to put it another way, even though Lady Bird will never be perfect, “Lady Bird” is." 0.742620673 "Comedy" "R" "A24" "" "" "" "" "25" "28-Jul-00" "19-Oct-00" "" NA
"146" "Lady Macbeth" "7/14/2017" "7/13/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/movies/lady-macbeth-review.html" 0 "It takes a while to figure out who the title character in “Lady Macbeth” really is. You may think you know her, that she’s the one who sleeps with death, the one pouring evil into her husband’s ear. Certainly the invocation of Shakespeare tips that there’s something dangerous about the lady of its house, an opaque beauty called Katherine (a very fine Florence Pugh). Yet part of this movie’s ticklish nastiness is that at first it isn’t at all clear whether she will be the master of doom or its helpmate. At just 17, Katherine looks like the innocent flower, but something wicked this way comes seductively, then savagely.
Set in 1865 rural England, “Lady Macbeth” opens with Katherine at the marriage altar, her head draped in a white veil that suggests virtue and slyly hints at the blood that will spill. She’s soon in the bedroom with her husband, Alexander (Paul Hilton), a scowler with angry, accusatory eyes who isn’t interested in her sexually or any other way. Their first night together, he brusquely orders her to undress, only to crawl into bed, leaving her naked, untouched and puzzled. This remains the template for a somewhat mysteriously cheerless, loveless marriage that finds Katherine more of a prisoner than a wife.
Not much happens at first, beautifully. Katherine is soon bored, but the director, William Oldroyd, ensures that you aren’t, with his use of sepulchral quiet, mesmerizingly steady framing and unnerving order, in which nothing is ever out of place, especially nothing human. There seem to be no books in the house, which is maintained by beaten-down servants and overseen by Alexander’s even more unpleasant father, Boris (a good Christopher Fairbank). Everything looks superficially lovely, especially Katherine, who is brushed and cinched, primped and readied by her maid, Anna (Naomi Ackie), like a doll that no one plays with. It’s unclear if Katherine can read; at times she barely speaks.
For the most part, Katherine watches, and we watch her watching, as the quiet grows louder, and the stillness grows eerier. Bidden to stay indoors — somehow the fresh air would be bad for her, or so the men of the house insist — she spends much of her time staring out a window, a familiar pastime for repressed, yearning women in fiction. Of Madame Bovary, the theorist Stephen Heath wrote: “The window is the frame of Emma’s dissatisfaction.” The same holds true for Katherine, whose window reveals the life that she’s been cut off from, even as it reminds her, day after lonely night, of the freedom on the other side of the glass.
Something happens, of course, rocking Katherine, the story and the visual order. Alexander leaves — there’s trouble at the family colliery — creating a void that she rapidly fills. She starts a bold, increasingly reckless affair with a groomsman, Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis), a rough number wildly out of his league and depth. Adultery soon begets murder, but even when Katherine is standing over a second corpse, it’s not obvious whether she’s a newly sprung prisoner of gender with a reasonable sociopolitical alibi (the patriarchy made her do it!) or just a psychopath in a fetching peacock-blue gown. Mr. Oldroyd doesn’t tip his hand, forcing you to choose.
The movie is based on “Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,” an 1865 novella by Nikolai Leskov that Dmitri Shostakovich turned into an opera and Andrzej Wajda adapted into a film. Like the novella, the movie opens up some interpretive leeway as it invites your sympathy for Katherine. She’s an unambiguous captive, trapped by sex and class, yet the viciousness that her liberation awakens — as carnal lust slips into bloodlust — precludes a facile redemptive reading. Mr. Oldroyd boxes Katherine in his attractive visuals, imprisoning her as her male relatives do. Yet his intellectual distance also turns her into a specimen, a pinned butterfly turned taxidermy beast.
Written by Alice Birch, this version of “Lady Macbeth” is most successfully complicated by Anna, a sympathetic character who doesn’t exist in the novella but takes on mounting importance here. Katherine, having been radically isolated by her husband and father-in-law, has no friends. Anna is Katherine’s closest companion by default and serves as maid and occasional minder; over time, Anna also becomes a moving, horrified witness to Katherine’s crimes, emotion that warms the insistent chill. That Anna is played by a black actress, and Katherine by a white one, adds race to the thickening intrigue, making a story of female oppression and domination, power and privilege that much more harrowing and ugly." 0.894940704 "Drama" "R" "Roadside Attractions" "" "$64,537 " "$1,129,408 " "" "1" "29-Feb-08" "16-Oct-08" "140" 20
"147" "Landline" "7/21/2017" "7/20/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/movies/landline-review.html" 0 "Nostalgia is not what it used to be. “Landline,” a fairly genial, diffident comedy about diffident, fairly generic people, plants its flag in 1995 and surveys a landscape of indie rock, “Must See TV” and the high-waisted bluejeans that have recently started coming back into fashion. Hillary Clinton is on television, sporting a hairband and a pink suit.
Mostly, though, as the movie’s title whimsically suggests, the mid-90s were an era of adorably quaint technology. Characters make calls from pay phones and listen to messages on answering machines. They take pictures with boxy little cameras, rent videocassettes of movies and make mix tapes on actual cassette tape. The members of an upper-middle-class New York household share a single desktop computer, with a dot-matrix printer and a slot for floppy disks.
One of those antique data-storage devices provides the pretext for a bit of plot. Ali (Abby Quinn), the younger of the two Jacobs daughters, discovers a trove of erotic poetry her father has been writing to someone other than his wife. These proto-sexts are part of a small epidemic of infidelity among the Jacobses. Ali’s older sister, Dana (Jenny Slate), recently engaged to her live-in boyfriend, Ben (Jay Duplass), sparks up some action on the side with Nate (Finn Wittrock), a guy she knew in college. “We’re a family of cheaters,” Ali says in disgust.
“Landline” was directed by Gillian Robespierre, who wrote it with Elisabeth Holm. They also collaborated on “Obvious Child,” which starred Ms. Slate, and which was notable for the mixture of sweetness and candor it brought to the subject of abortion. There was something bracing, as well as brave, about that film’s honesty. Oddly, the new one is much more cautious and decorous in its treatment of the emotional dynamics of a complicated family. For all the profanity and naughty behavior, it has the timid, ingratiating vibe of a television sitcom, sticking to safe and familiar emotional territory.
Or, more to the point, it might remind oldish viewers of a certain kind of observant, clever but unambitious independent film that came to prominence in the era it depicts. The characters are not badly drawn, but they stay within the lines. Dana is the flakier sister, and also the more responsible one. Ali is quiet, guarded and critical. She is both more reckless and more grounded than her parents suspect.
The parents, meanwhile, are near-caricatures of middle-aged compromise. Alan (John Turturro) clings to his literary ambitions and works at an advertising agency. His wife, Pat (Edie Falco), works in environmental policy but doesn’t talk much about it. They refer to a wilder life back in the ’70s, but, like much else in the movie, that feels more like a talking point than like an aspect of authentic experience.
Mr. Turturro and Ms. Falco, with their lived-in faces and deeply seasoned acting technique, provide Alan and Pat with more individuality than the script does. The filmmakers seem hesitant to make any of their characters too interesting. Each one is an assemblage of surface quirks and emotional responses, neatly inserted into a series of dramatic and comic situations. Some of these pay off nicely, in particular when Ms. Slate and Ms. Quinn share the screen and capture the jumpy, push-and-pull rhythms of loving but not entirely compatible sisters.
It’s strange to think that if Ali and Dana were real, they would now be in their early and later 40s. The fact that they seem so much like present-day young people is less an anachronism than an aspect of the film’s hopeful, soothing attitude. It’s a peace offering from Generation X to the millennials, a gesture of solidarity from one cohort of the metropolitan upper-middle class to another.

At his best — most canonically in the “Before” trilogy but also in films like “Slacker,” “Dazed and Confused” and “Waking Life” — he quiets the engine of plot, keeps the camera at a polite, attentive distance and lets people talk. The content of the conversations is important, but so are the more subtle kinds of information that human speech conveys: the unstated emotions and idiosyncrasies of character that flow alongside and underneath the words.
“Last Flag Flying,” Mr. Linklater’s new feature, is a suite for three voices. It’s a lot of other things, too. A war movie, in its way, and also a road picture and a memory play. Set in 2003, at the stage of the Iraq war when we were assured that the mission was being handily accomplished, it brings together three Vietnam veterans for a somber task. Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) and Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) are former Marines. Larry Shepherd (Steve Carell) — his nickname was Doc — served in the Navy. Long-buried bad memories shadow their reunion and complicate their camaraderie, and the circumstances of their meeting dredges up the painful and complex legacy of their not-so-long-ago war.
Back then, Doc served time in the brig and received a bad-conduct discharge — he mordantly calls it a “better career decision” — a fact that connects “Last Flag Flying” to an earlier work, Hal Ashby’s “The Last Detail.” That movie, released in 1973 and starring Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid and Otis Young, was based on a novel by Darryl Ponicsan, whose sequel to that book is the basis of Mr. Linklater’s film. (Mr. Linklater and Mr. Ponicsan collaborated on the screenplay.)
“Last Flag Flying” is not a literal continuation of “The Last Detail.” The names of the men and the details of their shared back story have been changed. A petty theft has been replaced by something grimmer and more specifically tied to Vietnam. But the new movie echoes its predecessor in shape and to some degree in mood. The three men make their way up the Eastern Seaboard, mostly by train, toward Portsmouth, N.H., stopping along the way to break up the trip and vary the scenery.
Portsmouth is where Doc did his time, and also where he married and raised the son whose burial is the purpose of the journey. The young man, who had enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school, died in Baghdad in what the military officially described as an ambush. Doc has sought out his old buddies — though the nature of their friendship is one of many ambiguities — to help bring his boy home. He refuses the offer of burial at Arlington National Cemetery, a choice that frustrates an officious colonel (Yul Vazquez) but that must nonetheless be honored. A member of the son’s company (J. Quinton Johnson) accompanies the older men.
“Last Flag Flying” often plays less like a tragedy than a low-key comedy in a tragic frame. Doc, Sal and Mueller are a perhaps too-perfectly mismatched set of contrasting styles and attitudes. Doc, younger than the other two — he was just a kid when they all first got mixed up together — is the quietest, a timid soul trying not to shrivel up with grief. Sal is the wild man, a motor mouth whose high spirits, you feel, could turn into violent rage in the blink of an eye. Mueller is a reformed hell-raiser who shut the door on his past, sobered up and found a measure of peace as a minister and the patriarch of a thriving family.
The three have a lot to talk about, and they also leave a lot unsaid. Mr. Linklater avoids flashbacks and other obvious ways of connecting the film’s present to its implied past. We don’t see any combat, either in Iraq or Vietnam, which gives the verbal accounts of what happened in those places extra weight and mystery. There is some political venting — none of which fits in a tidy ideological box — but mostly a lot of bluster, chops-busting and reminiscing to pass the time.
The time doesn’t always pass easily, though. The film, like the characters, feels like it’s working things out as it goes along. This is sometimes fascinating and sometimes frustrating. The performances don’t always connect. Mr. Cranston, leaning into a New York accent, his hands and face perpetually in motion, has the busy energy of a stage actor. Mr. Fishburne is a master of stillness, and the dissonance between them isn’t just a matter of the differences between Sal and Mueller. I never made the imaginative leap from performance to reality. The actors somehow got in the way of the characters.
But even if “Last Flag Flying” isn’t quite persuasive, it is nonetheless enormously thought-provoking, and its roughness is a sign of how earnestly it grapples with matters that other movies about war prefer not to think about. It is about the much-discussed division between members of the military and the rest of society, and also about the less frequently acknowledged conflicts within and among those who fight. It uses the language of heroism and sacrifice to challenge popular, sentimental notions of what those things mean, and to connect individual ethics with collective morality. None of that is easy, and what may be hardest to bear is the awareness that a country can sometimes look smaller than the people who serve it." 0.999252025 "Comedy" "R" "Lionsgate" "" "$40,558 " "$965,481 " "" "1" "4-Jan-17" "2-Feb-17" "30" 4.3

It couldn’t have been easy. He’s nearly entombed in facial makeup that obscures his own physiognomy — an actor’s landscape — while bringing to life Lyndon B. Johnson, a transitional, still-contentious figure of fascinating contradictions. This was, history tells us, a politician who early in his career spoke against civil rights legislation yet signed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, a president who declared an “unconditional war” on poverty at home even as he escalated the war in Vietnam.
Only some of that history makes it into this disappointing movie, which tracks Johnson’s road from the Senate to the vice presidency and then the presidency, an ascension that culminates with him assuming the role of the nation’s healer after John F. Kennedy’s death. It’s a near-miraculous, compressed coming into consciousness (the movie runs 98 minutes) that develops through different time frames and neatly dovetailing scenes that suggest history is plotted by that great filmmaker in the sky. One moment it’s 1960 and Johnson is weighing his chances as the next Democratic presidential nominee; the next, he is struggling to find a place in the Kennedy administration and vainly looking for political love in the Oval Office.
Mr. Harrelson makes Johnson an almost predictably entertaining force, and his performance fills the movie with oxygen whether he’s barnstorming through politics, slamming down phones, lobbing obscenities, braying at his staff from a toilet seat or gleefully grabbing his crotch while announcing that his tailor needs to make his pants roomier. He’s fun to watch despite the facial makeup, which is so distractingly exaggerated that when I wasn’t thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire I was flashing on the rubbery presidential masks worn by the bank robbers in “Point Break.” It’s a wonder that Mr. Harrelson can convey any emotion through all that latexy blubber much less keep drawing you closer to him. I recognized the similarly encumbered Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays Lady Bird, only when she started talking.
Directed by Rob Reiner from Joey Hartstone’s script, “LBJ” is a frustratingly underdeveloped vehicle for Mr. Harrelson’s talents as well as an unfortunate missed opportunity. Mr. Harrelson hits his beats with charismatic menace and a reverberant Texas twang, but he’s booming in a vacuum. Part of the problem is the filmmakers never figure out why this particular story needed to be told at this specific moment; it feels at once dutiful and arbitrary. That’s too bad, especially given that it could have continued a story told through Obama-era movies — “Selma,” “Jackie,” “Marshall” — that, both directly and obliquely, speak to the present through the convulsions of the 1960s.
Taken together, these movies create a kaleidoscopic portrait of a profoundly changing nation using black, female and marginal characters who once would have remained behind while the white hero went off to write history. They represent, onscreen and off, the very changes that they narrate. With its armies of pale men and next to no black characters, “LBJ” doesn’t look all that different from most other great-man stories.

As for the adults who’ll get dragged to the theater: You’ve seen it all before, though it’s pleasant enough to watch again.
Beginning at a French orphanage sometime around the 1880s, this good-natured tale finds 11-year-old Félicie (voiced by Elle Fanning) and her friend Victor (Nat Wolff) ready to run away to Paris, where she hopes to become a ballerina and he an inventor. After this generic pair is chased by the orphanage overseer (Mel Brooks, criminally underused) they arrive in the big city.
Félicie is the focus here, and soon she’s befriending Odette (Carly Rae Jepsen), a former dancer turned cleaning woman, and trying out for a prestigious ballet school as various villains conspire to quash her hopes. Along the way she is told to follow her dreams, to never give up and to take big risks.
Those messages are delivered often, and emphasized, to inspire young viewers. Fair enough. Less justifiable is the hit-or-miss humor and a well-worn plotline. Panoramic images of Paris, dance sequences and montages of Félicie in training add some energy.
Directed by Éric Summer and Éric Warin (and first released in Europe as “Ballerina,” sans that wanton exclamation point), “Leap!” remains peppy as it sets its bar at a low-to-medium height then cheerfully clears it. Sure, the movie could have heeded its own advice and taken a few risks. But the filmmakers know just what their younger audience wants — a sunny story and plenty of dancing — and they’re not taking any chances." 0.861270702 "Animation" "PG" "Weinstein Company" "" "$4,730,038 " "$21,858,070 " "" "731" "29-Mar-85" "" "" NA

Janicza Bravo’s feature debut, written with her husband and its star, Brett Gelman, traffics in the same anti-humor as Rick Alverson’s “The Comedy” and “Entertainment,” knowingly titled movies that offer nothing of the sort. Give “Lemon” credit, then: It’s a case of truth in advertising.
The movie opens with a woman on television recounting horrors in Africa, it seems, only to pivot to the viewer on the couch, something of a tragic case himself. Isaac (Mr. Gelman) is a failure in every respect: career, grooming and — we eventually discover — pet-sitting and bathroom hygiene. He appears in embarrassing ads. While working as an acting teacher, he pits two students (Gillian Jacobs and Michael Cera, sporting what looks like a rodent-chewed Art Garfunkel hairdo) against each other, perhaps for his amusement. Though he’s not laughing. After Mr. Cera’s character finds success, Isaac tags his car with a slur.
Isaac is also in a floundering relationship with a blind woman (Judy Greer), who respects him almost as little as he does her. In a centerpiece of sorts, Isaac attends a Passover Seder at which his brother (Martin Starr) questions the Jewishness of their sister (Shiri Appleby) and her black son (Blake Anthony Crawford). You could cry anti-Semitism, but you’d be taking the bait; the movie calculates its ethnic stereotypes to offend and dares you not to be in on the gag.
The protagonist eventually tiptoes toward functionality while wooing a woman (Nia Long) who, like Ms. Bravo, is black. At this point “Lemon” apparently becomes an inside joke about the filmmakers.

Bell was born into a wealthy British family in 1868, and was an avid traveler from an early age. This movie focuses on her time in the Middle East during the early 20th century and her role in drawing the modern borders of Iraq, which the United States and other countries have expended a good deal of blood and treasure to maintain and defend.
The directors asked the redoubtable Tilda Swinton to read Bell’s letters, and, in configuring the film as if it were made after Bell’s death in 1926, they cast actors in the roles of Bell’s contemporaries, such as T. E. Lawrence, Vita Sackville-West and Arnold Wilson. The actors appear as documentary-style talking heads. (On second thought, I don’t see how this idea could have looked good on paper.)
The strategy does, however, enable the filmmakers to keep Bell in a bubble, inoculated from the disapproval her work received in subsequent years. While she is still highly regarded by many Iraqis, the scholar Edward Said was critical of her in his landmark study “Orientalism.” With this movie’s framing, the directors don’t even have to bring him up. There’s much historical material here that’s of high interest, and Ms. Swinton’s performance of Bell’s letters convey Bell’s skills as a writer, but the movie is ultimately too conceptually labored for its own good — or that of its subject." 0.064801466 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Vitagraph" "" "$6,576 " "$13,692 " "$9,673 " "4" "9-May-08" "22-May-08" "-98" -14

It’s another entry in the tireless X-Men saga but doesn’t play like a retread or an ad for the next installment; instead, it plays, looks and sounds like a movie — an old-school meets new-school pulp filled with intimations of mortality, and raw, ugly violence. Once again, Hugh Jackman has saddled up to play the Wolverine, a mutant who also goes by Logan, and has always been the most satisfying character in the series. Mr. Jackman’s charm can lighten the glummest dirge, but for comic-book agnostics the real appeal is Logan’s reluctance to get involved, an ambivalence that can feel familiar to viewers exhausted by the same fight.
This is the ninth time that Mr. Jackman has played Logan, and while the character’s claws are intact, the movie is a major narrative and stylistic shift in its franchise universe. It was directed by James Mangold, who shares script credit with Scott Frank and Michael Green, and has the clarity and directness of a classic genre picture. It’s part western, part neo-noir, the kind of movie in which a stranger steps from the shadows and shakes off his isolation and existential burden long enough to right whatever wrong needs righting. You know him: He’s the man with the tight smile and split lip, the one whose hard talk never fully obscures his wounded soul.
The opener is kinetic, efficiently staged, casually sadistic and near-ritualistic in how it conforms to the genre playbook. Logan is napping in his parked car not far from the United States-Mexico border when he is awakened by a gang trying to steal his tires. It’s an archetypal poke-the-bear scene, the sort in which the hero announces his bona fides by eradicating villains too stupid to know what they are up against. Logan calls out to them, as if giving them fair warning. It’s pointless. Like most generic bad guys, these exist purely to wind the hero up — they’re the action-movie equivalent of foreplay — and soon Logan is slicing and dicing, spearing bodies like kebabs.
Scenes like these turn characters into garbage that the hero has to bag up and toss. That’s standard genre posturing, but Logan is as much a hero as an outlier and can’t descend into nihilism. He needs a cause, a banner to hoist. So the movie complicates its bloodletting, including through a story line about corporate violence run amok in a near-lawless future. Enter the rogue geneticist (played with restrained flair by Richard E. Grant) with a venal aide-de-camp (a charismatic Boyd Holbrook) and an army of paramilitary cyborgs. These, in turn, connect to Laura (a terrific newcomer, Dafne Keen), a watchful, feral child who is fleeing across borders.
Before long, Logan is playing the resistant head of a household that includes Laura as the ultimate in uncontrollable spawn and a sickly Professor X (Patrick Stewart) as their noble paterfamilias. Mr. Stewart, using a rasp that suggests decay is working its way out from the inside, does some beautiful work, especially with Mr. Jackman. Pushing and pulling at each other, they create a shared vulnerability that’s expressed both in physical degradations — the movie is filled with ravaged, traumatized bodies — and in the contrapuntal play between Logan’s gruff tenderness and Professor X’s floundering. (He’s Gramps by way of King Lear.)
Much of “Logan” is an extended chase sequence, with Logan et al. forced on the run while pursued by the corporate concern. There are detours and kind strangers, open skies and endless miles, carnage and politics. En route, Mr. Mangold occasionally resorts to cliché, but many of his choices feel fresh, paradoxically because he has the heart of a classicist. He has watched his share of Clint Eastwood and old Hollywood, too. He’s also a sentimentalist, as his nod to the 1953 western “Shane” suggests. (“A gun is a tool,” that film’s gunslinger says, “as good or as bad as the man using it.”) The romance of the righteous kill remains a cinematic article of faith.
“Logan” is a strong argument for bringing the comic-book movie down to earth. It solidly hits its marks as it moves the franchise furniture around, and features striking special-effects scenes in which the world shudders to a near standstill. Here, though, the pyrotechnics serve the story and are of a piece with a scaled-down realism that acknowledges — in its scars, viscera and flood of parentless children — the cost of the endless fight. It loves that fight, of course: That’s entertainment.

"157" "Logan Lucky" "8/18/2017" "8/16/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/movies/review-logan-lucky-steven-soderbergh-and-his-motley-band-of-thieves.html" 1 "In American movies — and maybe not only there — the idea of luck often functions as a euphemism for, and an antidote to, the effects of class. In a land of winners and losers, where life is acknowledged to be unfair and positive thinking is all-powerful, we often find fault (or solace) not in our social structures but in our stars.
“Logan Lucky,” Steven Soderbergh’s gravity-defying, ridiculously entertaining new film — one that ends a blessedly brief retirement from big-screen directing — concerns itself with a desperate attempt to even the odds. It’s a caper movie, a modern-day Robin Hood tale organized around an elaborate, improbable but curiously plausible heist. A gang that includes a wounded veteran, an unemployed former coal miner, a hairdresser and other motley members of the noncoastal nonelite conspires to knock over a Nascar race sponsored by Coca-Cola. The event sucks a lot of cash from people like them, and the thieves quite literally set out to suck it right back up.
That description might make the movie sound more pointed than it is. But Mr. Soderbergh’s class consciousness — something that has popped up often in his career, in “Erin Brockovich” and “The Girlfriend Experience,” in “Bubble” and, of course, in “Magic Mike” — is atmospheric rather than programmatic. Nobody in “Logan Lucky” utters a political word, but the setting carries a heavy, obvious charge of political significance all the same. The Logans in question are proud, hard-pressed residents of West Virginia, a state that, in the real world, punches far above its demographic weight in partisan and symbolic importance. Their land is beautiful and their water is contaminated. The film’s anthem is John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” a hillbilly elegy if ever there was one.
Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum), who plays the song for his young daughter, Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie), while they work on his pickup truck, knows that its authenticity is questionable. Two of the credited writers, he says, had probably never even been to West Virginia when they hymned the beauty of its valleys and rivers. (“Logan Lucky,” it should probably be pointed out, was shot mostly in Georgia.) But Jimmy also knows that even pop-culture artifice can carry a spore of genuine sentiment, and Mr. Soderbergh shows a similar faith in the impure products of America. A student of movie traditions high and low, he draws his inspiration here less from the gritty, downbeat realism of ’70s New Hollywood than from that decade’s good-time populist genre hybrids. If the “Oceans” series represented his updating of Kennedy-era Rat Pack swagger, “Logan Lucky” revives the irreverent, hell-raising outlaw vibe of “Smokey and the Bandit.”
Not that this movie feels in any way like a throwback. Mr. Tatum is about 10 times sexier than Burt Reynolds ever was, and about one-tenth as vain. Since his early screen appearances (in “Step Up” and “A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints”), it’s been evident that he is a singularly charismatic performer, but by now it should be clear that he’s also a great actor. I think his appeal has less to do with any supposed Everyman quality (though every man can dream, of course) than with an uncanny ability to convey irony and sincerity in the same gesture, to balance his effortless magnetism with unforced modesty.
Jimmy, once a high school football star, has not quite resigned himself to life on the short end of the stick. Laid off from a construction job in North Carolina, he returns home to discover that his ex-wife (Katie Holmes) and her car-dealer husband (David Denman) are planning to move out of West Virginia with Sadie. Jimmy’s brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), a bartender who lost a hand in Iraq, thinks the family is cursed. Jimmy doesn’t share this superstition, and in any case he has a plan, or at least a how-to list for bank robbers that he decides to adapt for new circumstances.
Like George Clooney’s Danny Ocean, he needs, first of all, to put together a crew. Starting with Clyde and their sister, Mellie (Riley Keough), Jimmy taps into another kinship network, recruiting an explosives expert named Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) and his two brothers (Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson). That’s not quite everyone, but there are some dandy little surprises in store that I’m not inclined to spoil.
Not that the plot is anything earth-shakingly original. “Logan Lucky” sticks to the “Oceans” template so faithfully that someone makes a joke about it. Who cares? The pleasures of the heist genre are always procedural and specific. These movies are all the same, but also always different because of the particular mix of personalities and circumstances. What they celebrate, above all, is the combination of craft, planning and problem-solving ingenuity that can turn a job of work into a work of art. They are, in other words, the quintessential movie movies, reflecting the collaborative challenges and logistical triumphs of the production cycle.
For that reason, a good heist movie can settle into a sweet spot where reality and fantasy converge. This one’s narrative engine hums along nicely, occasionally accelerating into farce, usually when Mr. Craig shows up, sporting neck tattoos, spiky bleached hair and an accent that sounds like the cause or the result of a badly sprained tongue. (The dialects are all over the map, but let’s not get too hung up on authenticity.)
Mr. Soderbergh never speeds through the twists and bumps. He downshifts and pulls onto the shoulder, letting the story take care of itself while the audience enjoys the sometimes funny, sometimes fractious, sometimes wistful pleasure of the characters’ company. By the time you encounter Hilary Swank’s F.B.I. agent, or figure out that the obnoxious British energy-drink mogul who is the only truly villainous character is Seth MacFarlane, you feel like you’re a family-reunion crasher who stuck around long enough to get promoted to second cousin.
Of the three movies released this summer that self-consciously reactivate an old-school outlaw mythology — the others are Edgar Wright’s “Baby Driver” and Josh and Benny Safdie’s “Good Time” — this one has the most to say and the least to prove. Whereas the other directors aggressively promote their own coolness, flaunting borrowed attitudes and showy retrofitted styles, Mr. Soderbergh revels in squareness, and in a loose self-confidence that disguises its mastery. “Logan Lucky” is a terrific movie. That’s a matter of skill, and maybe also of luck.

The rap artist Azealia Banks plays Coco, an aspiring hip-hop musician whose crew, the self-dubbed “Staten Island’s Finest,” is stalled with no record label interest. Her bandmate Malik (John David Washington) proves a faithless boyfriend, and Coco doesn’t split from the group, but does distance herself from it. “You want to rap? That’s fine with me,” Coco’s no-nonsense mother advises. “But from now on you’re going to have to do it between classes.”
At the small college where Coco studies accounting, she is led by her friend Julie (Hana Mae Lee) to a poetry class headed by the imperious, glamorous Professor Dixon (Jill Scott) and her handsome, young British-accented teaching assistant Derek (Lucien Laviscount). Both insist to Coco that rap and poetry are different things. She defiantly sets to prove them wrong, only to discover that in a way they’re right.
The script by Nicole Jefferson Asher toggles between sharp observations about wordcraft and some “Dynasty”- or Tyler Perry-level soap operatics. RZA’s direction lacks visual personality, but he keeps the narrative moving and elicits strong performances from his cast. The rap battle and poetry slams take place in settings that are brightly lit and — a few tetchy spats between rivals romantic and artistic notwithstanding — relaxed. The dangerous, poverty- and drug-plagued Staten Island from which RZA’s own music sprang feels very far away.

Sarah, who has a 3-year-old daughter, Jessie, communicates with her mostly absent husband, Dean (Cary Joji Fukunaga), via Skype. Scenes of Sarah and Jessie gently roughhousing capture the blissful mother-daughter bond with a poignant intensity, wrapping the viewer in the blanket of their intimacy.
The film begins with the two friends reuniting, and they soon embark with Jessie on a spontaneous road trip that takes them to eastern Pennsylvania, where they visit a rodeo and an amusement park and play a game called “truth or drink.” Amid gales of tipsy laughter, they pour out their confessions of naughty misdeeds and in quieter moments murmur endearments and exchange kisses. Each seems to be waiting for the other to define their relationship and carry it to the next level, but it doesn’t happen.
Three years pass, and Sarah drives to Tennessee to attend Mindy’s wedding to Leif (Ryan Eggold). Already there are signs Mindy is not fully committed to her fiancé, and is going through the motions for reasons that are never explained. And when Mindy’s bitter, hard-boiled mother (Rosanna Arquette) arrives, her gimlet eye zeros in on her daughter’s ambivalence and she bluntly asks her why she is going through with the wedding.
From the moment Sarah appears, tugs of longing and desire after their lengthy separation are as palpable as ever. The two steal time to be alone together as the final preparations are being made for a wedding filled with raucous off-color humor.
Ms. Keough’s soft, shy performance is as compelling as her chilling portrayal of a high-end escort in the Starz series “The Girlfriend Experience,” but completely opposite in tone. It is matched in power by Ms. Malone’s frisky but wary Mindy in a movie devoid of overt sexual politics in which “the L word” (lesbian) is never spoken." 0.760877278 "Drama" "Unrated" "Strand" "" "$4,301 " "$23,392 " "$21,316,209 " "2,219" "26-Jan-07" "15-Mar-07" "" NA

What if his paintings, with their wild colors and vibrant brush strokes, had been able to move? And what if the bullet that killed him had been fired by someone else?
A long and arduous labor of love by Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman, the film turns van Gogh’s work into an unusual kind of biopic. Using tens of thousands of oil paintings commissioned from scores of artists, the filmmakers transform famous works of modern art into a hypnotic and beguiling cartoon. The people van Gogh rendered on canvas — the provincial French functionaries, doctors, barmaids and farmers immortalized on museum walls — are brought to uncanny life, with the voices of professional actors, some of them well known.
They participate in a meandering detective story. Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth), the layabout son of a village postmaster (Chris O’Dowd), is instructed by his father to deliver a letter to Vincent’s brother Theo. Armand travels to Paris and then to Auvers-sur-Oise, the northern French town where Vincent died, leaving behind contradictory memories among the people he painted in his final years. They recall a passionate, hard-working artist, but not always the tormented, suicidal genius of legend.
That legend has been sustained by earlier movies, notably Vincente Minnelli’s rumbustious “Lust for Life” (with Kirk Douglas as van Gogh) and Robert Altman’s more cerebral “Vincent & Theo” (starring Tim Roth and Paul Rhys as the brothers).
Vincent himself (Robert Gulaczyk) is a more elusive presence in “Loving Vincent,” since most of its action is posthumous and self-portraits make up a relatively small part of his oeuvre. There are flashbacks, but the painter is evoked mainly through the dialogue of the other characters, as if he were the Maltese Falcon.
The principal mystery is the stuff of police procedural, as Armand doggedly tries to reconstruct van Gogh’s final weeks and shed light on the circumstances of his death. How miserable was he, and why? What secrets did he harbor? What enemies had he made?
The questions are interesting, but not quite sufficiently dramatized to sustain “Loving Vincent” for its full length. As the story limps and drags, the viewer also becomes accustomed to the images, and astonishment at the film’s innovative, painstaking technique begins to fade.

The story has a boilerplate quality to it — father with a drinking problem; a pair of polar-opposite brothers — yet a standout performance by Theo Rossi (“Sons of Anarchy”) as the black sheep of the family overcomes a lot of the film’s flaws.
The title refers to the car culture that took hold among Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles and elsewhere, centered on custom-made vehicles built low to the ground and outfitted with hydraulic lifts. Miguel (Demián Bichir), a pivotal member of a car club called the Coasters, is preparing his vehicle for a high-stakes competition. His reluctant assistant is his younger son, Daniel (Gabriel Chavarria), who would rather be honing his considerable skills as a graffiti artist than working on cars.
Miguel once hoped that Daniel’s brother, Francisco (Mr. Rossi), would be the one to aspire to lowrider greatness, but Francisco ended up in prison instead. He completes his long sentence just before the big car competition, and both Daniel’s and Miguel’s lives are complicated by his reappearance. Also complicating things is that Miguel has remarried since the boys’ childhoods; Eva Longoria is underused as his current wife.
There’s nothing subtle about this examination of cultural and generational clashes, and sometimes the director, Ricardo de Montreuil, and the screenwriters, Elgin James and Cheo Hodari Coker, veer into cliché land.

That doesn’t mean this leisurely portrait of its title character, a cantankerous old coot (Harry Dean Stanton, in one of his last roles), is any more eventful at the end than at the beginning. Rather, the accumulation of spot-on performances and long-familiar faces, small-town routines and dusty-worn locations, finally coalesces into a picture that’s greater than the sum of its oft-clichéd parts.
Maudlin and meandering, this first feature by the actor John Carroll Lynch could have sprouted organically from the compost of its star’s back catalog. (The script, by Logan Sparks and Drago Sumonja, was written as an almost biographical celebration of Mr. Stanton’s life.) We’ve seen him stride through arid desert towns like this before, though now, as Lucky, his gait is more fragile if no less purposeful. Following the same daily routine — an unvarying trek from home to diner to bodega to bar — Lucky would rather watch game shows than engage in small talk. The townsfolk (warmly played by David Lynch and Ed Begley, Jr., among others) don’t seem to mind, and are even quite fond of him, in the way of longtime owners of a rather surly pet.
Then, one day, he falls down, and the film subtly shifts from a quietly comical character study to a delicate reflection on loneliness and mortality. As Lucky bonds with a fellow World War II veteran and, in one lovely scene, slides into an impromptu song at a child’s birthday party, the movie is more intent on measuring the weight of a life than contemplating death. So when our cranky hero, a lifelong atheist, declares that there is no soul, it seems an extraordinary line to give an actor who spent his entire career proving otherwise." 0.444624383 "Drama" "Unrated" "Eros" "" "$147,800 " "$453,507 " "" "64" "24-May-13" "3-Oct-13" "133" 19

Julian Rosefeldt’s “Manifesto,” which originated as an art installation, has toured the world, recently roosting at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan. It consists of filmed readings of various artistic and political manifestoes, dating from Marx and Engels’s 1848 “Communist Manifesto” and moving through the 20th century to Dada, Fluxus and even Lars von Trier’s Dogme 95 rules for filmmaking.
In installation form, 13 readings play out simultaneously on 13 screens, challenging the viewer to pluck coherence from an audiovisual Babel of sorts. In the movie version, the scenes are laid out in a linear fashion, but one scene is divided so that the film begins and ends with it.
The manifestoes (the film draws from many more than 13 texts; some are merely one-line maxims) are not just read, they’re performed. And they’re all presented by the chameleonic actress Cate Blanchett. More than a performer, Ms. Blanchett is also a movie star, albeit a very particular caliber of movie star. Which is one of several reasons “Manifesto” works as well as it does in cinematic form.
Some of the settings are on the nose, but that does not mean they are ineffective. The Dada manifesto, announcing the death of art, is set at a funeral. Claes Oldenburg’s incantatory brief for pop art (“I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical”) is said as a prayer at the table of a family meal. (That the family is staid and middle-class and Southern tilts to a certain irony, however.)
In some cases, the words and actions are at odds. For the Fluxus manifesto, which denounces hierarchical culture and the elevated position of the artist within that culture, Ms. Blanchett vehemently enacts the text in the guise of a temperamental, overbearing Russian choreographer. The juxtaposition of words, images and settings is sometimes brilliantly comedic, as when Ms. Blanchett, portraying a big-haired TV news anchor with a smile that looks as if it were enforced by law, converses about Conceptual art with a remote weather reporter, also played by Ms. Blanchett.
As an installation, “Manifesto” may have seemed like a sensory onslaught. As a movie, it’s a very elaborate intellectual exercise, immaculate in every technical detail. (The sound design, by Fabian Schmidt and Markus Stemler, is particularly extraordinary.) And Ms. Blanchett’s work here is aptly cerebral. As virtuosic as her performances are, they’re purposely conscious of themselves. As an oblique examination and critique of political and art history and their various interactions over the 20th century, “Manifesto” is both witty and provocative. It is not, however, a motion picture for people seeking a plot." 0.990705569 "Drama" "R" "Cannon Films" "" "$6,451 " "$17,930 " "$79,839,675 " "15" "21-Sep-12" "18-Apr-13" "210" 30

Normally, that fearsome Vogue editor wears sunglasses — in the front row of fashion shows; when she was made a dame earlier this year. But for Manolo Blahnik, maker of some of the most sublime women’s footwear of the past four decades, she drops the lenses and lets her eyes, and feelings, show.
Mr. Blahnik inspires this warmth by dint of his shoes and also his character, which is eccentrically patrician, starry eyed, elegant. (He wears the hell out of a lilac suit.) He’s a man who describes wisteria — the word, but presumably also the plant — as “so Olympic, it’s so hedonistic in a way.”
But this film, directed by the fashion writer and editor Michael Roberts, doesn’t aspire beyond embrace. It rushes through Mr. Blahnik’s biography, dwelling on pop-culture moments and blandly ecstatic celebrity testimonials (not counting the uproarious André Leon Talley, who insists Mr. Blahnik is “up there with Baudelaire”). It also leans heavily at times on recreated footage of Mr. Blahnik’s childhood, as well as on a bizarre scene imagining a 1930s African society party in which a white woman emerges from a gorilla costume.
There is little accounting of his inner life, or for that matter of his creative gifts, which are quite exquisite. And though there are some cleverly conceived but blindingly lighted scenes of Blahnik shoes in nature, or nestled amid sculpture or architecture, there is nothing systematic to the way the shoes are discussed or filmed. In a scene puzzlingly late in the film, Mr. Blahnik, who apparently still makes samples by hand, walks through his factory and finesses a sensuous heel out of a stump of wood. More of that would have made this confection about a radiant man into something sturdier." 0.903931315 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Music Box Films" "" "$8,387 " "$7,491,903 " "$911,771 " "10" "14-Oct-11" "17-Nov-11" "35" 5

Just so we’re clear: I’m describing the premise of a new movie starring Liam Neeson. What did you think?
The movie is “Mark Felt — the Man Who Brought Down the White House,” and the headlines from which it was ripped are more than four decades old. The title sounds like a category error, since the White House, as of this writing, is still standing. But Mark Felt, though almost nobody knew back in the ’70s, was undoubtedly instrumental in ending the presidency of Richard M. Nixon. The associate director of the F.B.I. at the time of the Watergate burglary, Felt entered the annals of Nixon-era scandal as Deep Throat, a pseudonym bestowed by the Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward.
Felt, who didn’t much like the name, identified himself as Mr. Woodward’s source in 2005. The memoir he published before his death in 2008 has been turned, by the writer and director Peter Landesman, a former journalist, into a hectic, intermittently intriguing and accidentally timely procedural thriller, with Mr. Neeson in the title role. His face as sharp as the blade of a hatchet, his brow creased with his weariness and his eyes ablaze with indignation, Mr. Neeson is a mighty presence on a small, cramped stage.
The word Shakespearean often attaches itself to the Nixon administration — it’s an adjective that marks the place where political power intersects with moral instability — and “Mark Felt” tries to infuse some dramatic grandeur into what is in essence a chronicle of bureaucratic scheming. The president and most of the president’s men are rarely seen and only occasionally heard over the phone. Felt and his F.B.I. colleagues hustle in and out of offices, whisper in corridors and ride in dark, period-appropriate sedans. For the benefit of viewers who may have trouble distinguishing one white guy in a suit from another (the earnest and talented supporting cast includes Josh Lucas, Tony Goldwyn, Ike Barinholtz and Brian d’Arcy James), they often address one another by full name and title.
Even for die-hard Watergate nerds, the movie can be a tough slog. The main conflict is between Felt and his new boss, L. Patrick Gray (Marton Csokas), who Felt comes to believe is functioning as Nixon’s mole in the F.B.I., and who also wants to limit the bureau’s Watergate inquiries. (Gray is also the man who took the job Felt thought should have been his, and wounded pride may be among his motives.) Meanwhile, on the home front, Felt and his long-suffering, heavy-drinking wife, Audrey (Diane Lane), worry about their daughter, who has vanished into the mists of the counterculture. There is a potentially interesting tension between Felt’s professional duties and his personal life that never fully takes shape.
“Mark Felt” is a sharp portrait set against a blurry background, a history lesson that won’t help you on the test. It is possible to savor the crags and shadows of Mr. Neeson’s performance without quite grasping why Mr. Landesman thinks the story is worthy of such somber, serious and sustained attention. Both the internal politics of the F.B.I. in the aftermath of J. Edgar Hoover’s death and the larger political and social dramas of the late ’60s and early ’70s are invoked, but neither the national nor the institutional stakes are illuminated with sufficient clarity or force." 0.827471482 "Biography" "PG-13" "Sony Classics" "" "$34,217 " "$768,946 " "" "3" "5-Sep-03" "11-Sep-03" "7" 1

With economy, a bit of gauzy nostalgia and likable performances, it revisits an early episode from the life of Thurgood Marshall, the civil rights lawyer who became the first African-American to hold a seat on the Supreme Court. From the 1940s to the early ’60s, he argued 32 cases before the court, winning most. “Sometimes history takes things into its own hands,” Marshall once said, but he also regularly gave history a shove.
“Marshall” isn’t about the famous cases that he argued in front of the court, including the history-making Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which led the court to declare racially segregated public schools unconstitutional. Instead, the movie focuses on a 1941 case involving Eleanor Strubing, a wealthy white woman from Greenwich, Conn., who accused her black chauffeur and butler, Joseph Spell, of raping her and then pushing her off a bridge. After hours of questioning, Spell confessed. The racist reactions to the charges, which invoked the dangerous Jim Crow stereotype of the ravaging black man, caught the notice of N.A.A.C.P., which sent Marshall to the rescue.
Jauntily self-possessed, the movie’s Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) rides in like a cavalry of one, taking the measure of the town and its escalating tension. He’s soon joined by another lawyer, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad), a button-down type who reluctantly joins the defense and reasonably fears the attention it will bring. The pair’s introduction immediately sets the alpha and beta tag-team dynamic: Thurgood casually asks for a hand with his bags, and Sam ends up carrying the load. The scene telegraphs the shifting power dynamics Thurgood represents, but it also announces that the movie will resort to easy, ingratiating comedy to sell the goods.
Seamlessly directed by Reginald Hudlin from a script by the father-and-son team of Michael and Jacob Koskoff, the movie primarily involves Thurgood’s strategy to free Joseph. Part of what made the case important to the N.A.A.C.P., as the scholar Daniel J. Sharfstein has written, was that it took place in the North instead of the South, where the organization was fighting on multiple fronts. In the 1930s, the activist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that the idea that there was no prejudice in the North was a fable. “The difference between North and South in the matter of segregation,” he wrote in 1934, “is largely a difference of degree.”
“Marshall” takes up that refrain both in its restaging of the trial and through the evolution of Thurgood and Sam’s slow-warming relationship. As the case comes into focus, Joseph (Sterling K. Brown) and Eleanor (Kate Hudson) take their opposing seats, the jury troops in, and the nasty judge (James Cromwell) starts snarling. Thurgood rapidly takes the lead while slyly poking and strategically prodding Sam to rise to the occasion. Thurgood and Sam banter, lash out, jostle for position and occasionally deliver some stink eye, especially Sam (at Thurgood). Like his character, Mr. Boseman is the star of this show, while Mr. Gad is the second banana and often comic relief. Both performers are natural showmen who never step on each other’s moment; they’re fun to watch.
It’s all a bit too much fun at times. The chuckles and legal-eagle bromance make the difficult, disturbing story flow easily, but there are moments when you wish that Mr. Hudlin would ease up on the comedy. Sam, in particular, occasionally comes uncomfortably close to a being a caricature, one of those bespectacled, emasculated types who need a kick in the pants, a sock in the jaw, so they can man up. The broadness of the characterizations is of a piece with the movie’s anxious rhythms and relentless forward drive. These may be a function of the clock running out on Joseph, along with a desire to entertain. But there’s little reflective or quiet time with the characters, these men of righteous action who chase clues before swooping into court and history.
“Marshall” also stumbles somewhat with the he-said, she-said wrangling. The filmmakers effortlessly lay out the very real existential dangers threatening Joseph, whose fate rests either with Thurgood or the howling white mob outside. But the overly broad performances, especially in the zippy courtroom scenes, drain the movie of nuance and blunt its realism, and the contrapuntal his-and-her flashbacks add little. Ms. Hudson’s performance, with its brassy and brittle notes, and its counterfeit hauteur, comes perilously close to cartoonish. She doesn’t do much for courtroom suspense, and neither does the irresistible Mr. Brown, a world-class scene-stealer whose quavering voice and pleadingly earnest eyes make the strongest case by far." 0.969941704 "Biography" "PG-13" "Open Road Films" "$12,000,000 " "$3,000,805 " "$10,051,659 " "" "6" "19-Sep-14" "16-Oct-14" "28" 4

The action kicks off with a speech by Jin Hyun-pil (Lee Byung-hun), chairman of the One Network corporation. In reality, One Network bilks investors and maintains a far-reaching web of bribes.

The key is to not overplay the hand. Gabriela Cowperthwaite seems to recognize that in her direction of “Megan Leavey,” letting this irresistible real-life story tell itself with a minimum of manufactured sentiment.
The title character (winningly played by Kate Mara) is a restless young woman who enlists as the Iraq war is starting, mostly to escape small-town nowheresville, and then by happenstance finds herself doing kennel-cleaning duty for the bomb-sniffing dogs at Camp Pendleton.

“Everything you feel goes down-leash,” a trainer tells her. “If you’re not confident, he’s not confident.”
The two are deployed to Iraq, and it’s not hard to guess what’s coming, since we have seen this type of harrowing work in documentaries and news coverage. The film’s biggest flaw is that the pivotal scene isn’t well set up; it seems as if Leavey’s unit were sent to a wasteland full of explosives for no reason other than to be blown up.
The movie also presents a somewhat idealized view of military service, especially for women. But the war isn’t really the point here; the relationship between a woman and a dog is.

For sure, this funny and tender film prompts cheerful smiles, but sometimes they turn melancholy.
Set in a Hasidic neighborhood in Borough Park, Brooklyn, the story finds the title character (played by Menashe Lustig) working in a small supermarket. He’s constantly berated by his boss and others, and their criticisms aren’t always without cause: Menashe is often late and prone to blunders, and is usually short of money.
Outside of his job, he has a bigger worry: regaining custody of his son. Menashe is a widower, and his orthodox Jewish faith requires him to raise his child, Rieven (Ruben Niborski), in a home with a mother. A rabbi has decreed that until Menashe remarries, Rieven must live with an aunt and uncle. That same rabbi, however, has allowed father and son to spend a week together before Rieven returns to those relatives.
Over the week, the two bond, argue and work, all of it shown with a naturalism that can be clumsy or graceful, but it always feels authentic. One mostly silent scene, showing them simply spending time with each other, is moving in its affection. Another scene, when Menashe is on a date arranged by a matchmaker, generates both winces and laughs.
Joshua Z. Weinstein, the director, shot the film in Yiddish and often in secret in Hasidic neighborhoods. His images are unaffected and candid, with wordless close-ups that speak for themselves. Mr. Weinstein made documentaries before this, his first fiction feature, and it shows.
The script, which he wrote with Alex Lipschultz and Musa Syeed, was inspired by Mr. Lustig’s experiences, and the actors are nonprofessionals whose performances ring true. Mr. Lustig is wonderfully empathetic, still more so when he’s paired with the splendid young Mr. Niborski.
The film is worth praising for what it is and admiring for what it’s not — there’s no sappiness or false emotion, and none of the clichéd, quirky misfits who populate so many commercial comedies. (It’s a fine addition to several recent indie features, including “Man Push Cart” and “Stand Clear of the Closing Doors,” that examine pockets of overlooked city dwellers.) “Menashe” also gently raises a few questions about faith, change and conformity.
Menashe himself is not always easy to like. He can be clever and friendly yet foolish and wrong: In other words, he’s awfully real. At times you’ll feel like shaking him in frustration for his actions. But minutes later, you’ll want to put an arm around this big man’s shoulder and, together with him, hope that things will be all right." 0.993516139 "Drama" "PG" "A24" "" "$62,078 " "$1,703,036 " "" "1" "16-May-03" "11-Sep-03" "84" 12

It’s hard to root for a protagonist who is focused only on his own narrow needs and seems indifferent to the broader issues his tale raises.
The film, which we’re told is inspired by a true story, is about the title character (Tim Boardman), a gay high school boy in small-town Illinois in 1999, whose father dies as the movie opens. Miles and his mother (Molly Shannon) soon learn that the man had squandered Miles’s college money on an affair, which leaves Miles desperate: He had been counting on escaping to Chicago for college.
When he learns that Loyola University has a men’s volleyball scholarship available, he vows to impress the coach, which means that he has to join the girls’ volleyball team at his high school, since it has no boys’ team. The film, directed by Nathan Adloff, who wrote the script with Justin D. M. Palmer, tries to frame this as some kind of empowering step, but because Miles never does more than pay lip service to an interest in volleyball, his teammates or the competitive imbalance his presence is perceived to create (opponents begin forfeiting), it’s hard to see his quest as anything but selfish.

It focuses on Kiet Engels, a teacher introduced as she methodically sets up her classroom for another day. What separates her class from those in other Dutch villages is that her students are migrant children, many of them Syrian. So in addition to the usual curriculum of reading, writing and arithmetic, Miss Kiet gently but determinedly instructs them in the hard work of assimilation, teaching them in Dutch and encouraging them to play with Dutch children.
Petra Lataster-Czisch and Peter Lataster direct the film in a fly-on-the-wall style; the young students don’t seem bothered by the camera, at least in the footage used. And as the movie progresses, a handful of precocious personalities emerge. There is Haya, who appoints herself a mentor for a new girl, Leanne, and assists her with penmanship in a way that crosses the line from helping to bossing around. (Miss Kiet sees what’s going on and intervenes.) And there is Jorj, whose younger brother, Maksim, clings to him, who sulks when he’s told he needs to take off his outdoor shoes for gym and who struggles with math.
As in Nicolas Philibert’s similar French documentary “To Be and to Have” (2002), the relative absence of conflict in the interactions between a seasoned teacher and wonderful pupils grows tedious at feature length, and there is — presumably by design — relatively little meat on this documentary’s bones. We learn nothing about how the school runs or why it’s a locus for refugees. The film includes only incidental tidbits about the students’ lives outside the classroom or before their arrival in the Netherlands, although in a charged moment late in the film, Miss Kiet asks Jorj about his life in Syria, where he played football inside the house to avoid what he calls the “bang, bang” outside.
“Miss Kiet’s Children” may seem soft and insubstantial in isolation, but it’s worth remembering that the movie was made before the far-right politician Geert Wilders fell short of gaining the seats his party sought in the 2017 Dutch election. Nor is the movie’s message limited to Holland. At Film Forum, “Miss Kiet’s Children” will screen with a Norwegian short that is animated in a style that suggests Jacob Lawrence and is drawn from interviews with children from Ivory Coast." 0.468250221 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Icarus Films" "" "$14,471 " "$21,821 " "$66,000,000 " "2,085" "25-Jun-93" "" "" NA

Case in point: “Monster Trucks,” a spry, spirited and delightful family film that has nothing to do with giant-wheeled vehicles piling on top of one another in indoor arenas. Instead, it’s an eco-fable devoid of didactic overkill, delivered with energy, winking mischief, unobtrusive effects and a skilled cast.
An oil company, personified by its chief executive (a rapacious Rob Lowe), is drilling in North Dakota when it hits a water-table mother lode of biological activity. A geyser releases an entity that finds its way to the small-town high-school senior Tripp (Lucas Till, the new MacGyver), whose buff physique and cleft chin belie his outsider status. Tripp, living with his working-class mother (Amy Ryan) and resenting her sheriff boyfriend (Barry Pepper), is a gear head seeking “something with four wheels that will get me out of this place.”
Working at a junkyard, Tripp bonds with the creature, which he names Creech after an initial encounter redolent of the “E. T.” playbook. Creech, a huge cephalopod, subsists on oil, and takes up residence in Tripp’s decrepit jalopy, sometimes impertinently seizing control. (It’s an inspired C.G.I. creation, alternately threatening and childish, with expressive eyes, formidable teeth and an irrepressible chortle.)
Back at the drilling site, Creech’s relatives are captured, and the oil company dispatches a heavy (Holt McCallany) to apprehend Creech. It falls to Tripp, a sympathetic geologist (Thomas Lennon) and Tripp’s friend Meredith (the winning Jane Levy, from “Don’t Breathe” and the underrated film “Fun Size”) to reunite Creech with his kin. Antic effects-laden car chases in town and country ensue, leading to a tender climax.

“Moscow Never Sleeps,” a Russian-Irish coproduction by the director Johnny O’Reilly, who was raised in Ireland and is now partly based in Moscow, seems intended as a counterweight. It depicts Moscow as a bright metropolis filled with immigrants, traffic jams, restaurants and clubs, the settings for familial dysfunction and frustrated love affairs. But while the tone is novel, at least by stateside art-house standards, dramatically “Moscow Never Sleeps” is resolutely familiar, even trite.
Citing “Short Cuts,” “Magnolia” and “Crash” as influences, Mr. O’Reilly has structured the movie as a series of interlocking stories. Most of it is set on City Day, the holiday that celebrates Moscow’s founding.
Viewers will eventually find out how the dying actor (Yuri Stoyanov) who sneaks out of the hospital and is roped into spending the day with insistent fans connects to the teenager (Anastasia Shalonko) searching for her father. Elsewhere, a businessman (Aleksey Serebryakov, from Mr. Zvyagintsev’s “Leviathan”) plans to fight the takeover of his project by the Russian government from outside the country. But the movie tiptoes around politics, focusing on the character’s love-hate feelings toward Moscow and how his imminent departure affects his relationship with a singer (Evgenia Brik).

A sensational point guard from Queens, he was named a high school all-American four years running. After Anderson spent two years at Georgia Tech, the New Jersey Nets made him the No. 2 pick in the 1991 N.B.A. draft. He was all of 20.
Yet as “Mr. Chibbs,” Jill Campbell’s documentary, notes, Anderson’s career plateaued. He was an All-Star in 1994 and made tens of millions of dollars. Even so, he bounced around, playing for nine teams over 14 seasons. The last time he made any real basketball news, it was as a member of the team Dennis Rodman took to North Korea in 2014.
“Mr. Chibbs” — the nickname Anderson’s mother gave him — chronicles a pro athlete in midlife crisis. Now in his 40s, he ticks off his situation: father of eight; married three times; a bankruptcy filing. He briefly coached at a Florida high school, a job he loved but lost after a D.U.I. arrest. “I’m a walking mistake,” he says.
Anderson is candid, rueful and self-knowing. He acknowledges the therapy he undergoes for the sex abuse he endured as a youngster and the depression he fights. He says he wasn’t there for his children, and is only now learning to be a better father and husband. Still, the film, like its subject, frustrates in its inability to focus; there is no deep inquiry into what makes Anderson tick. It’s like skimming a stone across a lake.
Ms. Campbell follows Anderson on a memory tour, visiting places and people from his past. At the LeFrak City housing complex, where he grew up, former neighbors still love him. His onetime agent, David Falk, suggests that he mentor N.B.A. rookies about the hazards of early wealth.

"175" "Mudbound" "11/17/2017" "11/16/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/movies/mudbound-review-dee-rees.html" 1 "“Mudbound” is a movie about how things change — slowly, unevenly, painfully. It is also, as the title suggests, about how things don’t change, about the stubborn forces of custom, prejudice and power that lock people in place and impede social progress. Set mainly in the Mississippi Delta in the years just after World War II, when Jim Crow was still enshrined in law and practice, the film, directed by Dee Rees, tests and complicates William Faulkner’s much-quoted claim about the not-even-pastness of the past. It’s a work of historical imagination that lands in the present with disquieting, illuminating force.
The particular corner of the past that Ms. Rees investigates is not entirely unfamiliar. The source of the screenplay for “Mudbound” (which the director wrote with Virgil Williams) is a novel by Hillary Jordan that counts Faulkner and Toni Morrison among its evident literary influences. On film, the racial history of the American South tends to be flattened into reassuring morality tales in which black lives matter less than white consciences. Ms. Jordan’s book occasionally wanders in the direction of this kind of soothing, redemptive storytelling — the white characters are split a bit too neatly into the righteous and the wicked, their black counterparts confined to salt-of-the-earth nobility — but the movie resists this tendency. Its people, members of two families knotted together by fate, hate and economics, are complicated. The wounds are raw.
What you notice first of all, though, is the land those people inhabit, a sometimes dusty, sometimes swampy area of broad fields and dirt roads that seems indifferent to human concerns. The cinematographer, Rachel Morrison, brings the soil, the flora and the weather to life in a way that emphasizes the archaic, elemental power of the story. Its modern implications are supplied by a cast of subtle actors and by Ms. Rees’s knack for psychological nuance, an attentiveness to quiet moments and unstated emotions that animates her earlier films, the independent coming-of-age drama “Pariah” and the HBO biopic “Bessie.”
“Mudbound” provides her a larger canvas and a sprawling, crowded plot. Relying on multiple narrators to tell a tale (as Ms. Jordan does) is a common enough novelistic technique, but movies sometimes sag under the weight of even a single voice-over. The half-dozen voices who reflect on the meaning of the onscreen action might have been distracting or confusing, but instead, remarkably enough, they provide an almost musical structure and a feeling of moral gravity. What happens is a communal tragedy, but one that is experienced differently by everyone involved.
The Jacksons are African-American tenant farmers who have managed, through years of toil, to arrive at a measure of stability and the guarded hope that something better might be possible in the future. The land they work is purchased by Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke), whose agriculture and business skills fall short of his ambitions. He and his wife, Laura (Carey Mulligan), come to rely on Hap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Mary J. Blige). Henry’s feckless younger brother, Jamie (Garrett Hedlund), befriends the Jacksons’ oldest son, Ronsel (Jason Mitchell). Both Ronsel and Jamie are combat veterans, and their natural camaraderie breaks the rules of racial separation, particularly infuriating Jamie and Henry’s father, a hateful old cur they call Pappy (Jonathan Banks).
Pappy’s snarling, slur-spewing villainy verges on caricature, but “Mudbound” does not pretend that his is the only, or even the most insidious, face of white supremacy. Nor does the film locate the poison of racism principally in the attitudes and feelings of the dominant race. What Hap and Florence are up against as they try to provide for their children and hold onto their dignity is a system of organized expropriation — a heritage of plunder (to borrow a term from the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates) designed to keep them poor, precarious and dependent. Their labor provides an insurance policy for Henry’s bad luck and incompetence. Their successes will be punished so his failures can be mitigated and his entitlement upheld. What’s theirs is his.
The more sympathetic members of the McAllan clan — Laura, a bookish, musical, cultivated woman dragged into the mud by the blunt force of her husband’s will, and Jamie, a dissolute, poetic soul of the kind Tennessee Williams would have recognized — are in some ways more dangerous to the Jacksons. Ronsel has seen enough of the world and tasted enough freedom to find the strictures of home intolerable. His insistence on behaving like a citizen already puts him at risk: After both world wars, black veterans were frequent targets of white violence. But Jamie, in his blithe disregard for local norms, is protected in a way Ronsel is not, and his refusal to grasp that asymmetry has terrible consequences.
I won’t spell those out. “Mudbound” begins with the digging of a grave and then jumps backward in time to move slowly toward the shadow of at least one death. Along the way, quite a lot happens — a bit too much, perhaps. There are subplots that might have been excised and twists that are a little too contorted. But Ms. Rees also knows that plot is not everything, and she uses Ms. Jordan’s busy narrative as a trellis rather than an engine. What happens is less important, finally, than who it is happening to.
What stays with you are everyday moments — the wordless communication between Hap and Florence, the aimless soldiers’ talk between Jamie and Ronsel, Laura’s lonely patience, Henry’s simmering insecurity — and the graceful performances that bring them to life. The way those instances of ordinary human tenderness and decency stand out is proof of the film’s achievement, which is to lay bare a world in which cruelty is normal and injustice seems as implacable as the weather." 0.928520163 "Drama" "R" "Netflix" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" NA

Charles Mully was born in Kenya and abandoned by his family at 6; he later stole and begged on the streets. Through the generosity of strangers, hard work and some prayer, he not only found a job but became wealthy by running several companies, including a bus service and oil and gas ventures.
To the surprise of his wife and eight children, Mr. Mully one day decided to give up business and devote his resources to Nairobi’s orphans. He turned his residence into a shelter, moving in dozens of homeless Kenyans (while sending some of his own children away to boarding schools). Later he built an orphanage that has housed and fed thousands; a farm there is dedicated to environmentally friendly agriculture.
Scott Haze, the director, is eager to inspire. Interviews show Mr. Mully to be resolute, and his family kindhearted. Yet the film’s tone sometimes turns repetitive. In one short section, a few orphans tell of their lives before meeting Mr. Mully. Their brutal recollections are essential to hear, but Mr. Haze hurriedly retreats from those and other harsh topics. Just as vexing, redundant voice-overs describe what is being shown; while Mr. Mully speaks of events, scripted scenes re-enact them.
“Mully” nods toward its subject’s religious faith but refrains from preachiness. Mr. Mully’s actions speak for themselves, and his robust personality makes him a pleasure to listen to.

In my early teens I saw the then-grand movie adaptation, an all-star cast affair directed by Sidney Lumet and featuring Albert Finney as the finicky Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Christie’s novel derives much of its notoriety from the solution to its mystery. It’s very novel; whether it’s ingenious or just ostentatious is still debated by mystery lovers. But even more than 40 years after Mr. Lumet’s film I had presumed that the ending was so well-known that there would be little point in a remake. And yet, as the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins said in a different context, generations have trod, have trod, have trod, and there are plenty of millennials who haven’t read the book.
Mr. Finney’s embodiment of Poirot in the Lumet picture was a marathon of sorts, with the actor testing how many of the beloved character’s irritating yet endearing quirks could be pushed to the limits of coherence. In this latest version, Kenneth Branagh, who also directs (from a script by Michael Green), gives us a Poirot who’s fussy but not too fussy, and rather crisp in his English-language diction. Most radically, this is a Poirot with heart. This interpretation is a dumb idea, but Mr. Branagh, an actor of prodigious skills, can at least pull this one half off. It’s not the only dumb idea in this film, which nevertheless bounces along in a way that’s sometimes almost entertaining.
Mr. Branagh shot the film in the 65-millimeter format, which offers a particular kind of “big movie” resolution. People tend to think that big-gauge celluloid is best for big-vista movies, such as “Lawrence of Arabia,” but Mr. Branagh’s picture is set almost entirely on a train. It is a very opulent train, and the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos gets all its ornate detail. It also gets the detail of the mostly C.G.I. special effects and settings, and here the marriage of digital and analog is awkward. In further pursuit of 65-millimeter shots, Mr. Branagh opens up the story regularly, however. He has the train stall on a cliff-side rail, supported by elaborate scaffolding on which he stages a foot chase. He has Poirot deliver his final summation of the case in a train tunnel.
As in Mr. Lumet’s adaptation, the supporting cast here is full of stars. Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Penélope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, and newer faces like Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr., fill out the roster of subjects. Johnny Depp, who is known to make some eccentric choices in crafting his characters, does not (necessarily) disappoint in the role of the murder victim, Edward Ratchett. Imbuing that unsavory character with the dopiest of gangster mannerisms, Mr. Depp may remind you of Matt LeBlanc’s “Friends” character, Joey Tribbiani. It’s as if Joey, that lovable bad actor, is trying to make the most of his first big break in the movies." 0.908902282 "Crime" "PG" "Paramount" "" "" "$27,634,716 " "" "" "27-Jul-18" "" "" NA

I recall a guy who, on the one hand, had facial hair before anybody else in his class and, on the other, wore a slide rule attached to his belt. I wonder what happened to him.
In “My Friend Dahmer,” written and directed by Marc Meyers and adapted from a graphic novel memoir by Derf Backderf, that one kid is, yes, Jeffrey Dahmer, who shortly after completing his studies at an Ohio high school began his career as a sex offender, serial killer and cannibal. In this account, the teenage Dahmer is a withdrawn fellow who dissolves roadkill in acid in a shed behind his house and indulges in attention-getting classroom antics. For these he is adopted, in a sense, by three other nerds. Their mischief-making alternates with sometimes grisly scenes in which Dahmer contends with emerging obsessions. When a disturbed schoolmate cuts open his palm and drinks the blood, the others disperse, but Dahmer stands staring, transfixed.
This film is sensitively wrought. It’s credible in its evocation of mid-’70s suburbia. The acting is excellent throughout, and Ross Lynch in the role of Dahmer elicits genuine sympathy for an increasingly lost but not yet monstrous soul.

That may be why he prefers to be called Courgette (Zucchini). It’s more down to earth. He spends his time flying a homemade kite from the window of an attic room decorated with his mother’s empty beer cans. There are quite a few of those. Zucchini’s father, whose likeness decorates the kite, is long gone, and an unfortunate accident soon removes Zucchini’s mother from the picture.
Zucchini, who is 9, is sent to a group home in the countryside, where he falls in with other abused, neglected and abandoned children. Perhaps because “My Life as a Zucchini,” directed by Claude Barras and based on a book by Gilles Paris, comes from France (and Switzerland), the orphanage is a place of kindness rather than terror. The French republican imagination assumes that institutions are benevolent. Wickedness resides in individuals, in this case the parents whose failures and outright crimes have damaged the innocence of Zucchini and his new friends.
Also, because “My Life as a Zucchini” is an animated film — a loving work of stop-motion cartoon handicraft and a long-shot Oscar nominee — it is more charming than grim. The orphan at large in the world is a fixture of folklore and literature as well as social-service case files, and Mr. Barras’s film, with its bigheaded, asymmetrical modeling-clay figures and off-kilter picture-book backdrops, explores a harsh situation with gentle whimsy.
Still, a bit of caution may be in order for parents. While nothing shown onscreen is graphic or disturbing, the movie is frank about the way the characters have been treated and also about their natural curiosity regarding the adult world. Viewers who have read contemporary young-adult literature will be able to handle it, though their parents may feel uncomfortable at times. Children of Zucchini’s age or younger might be freaked out.
The point of the story, in any case, is not horror but healing. It’s a bittersweet celebration of friendship and empathy, as Zucchini makes peace with a bully named Simon and develops a crush on a newcomer named Camille. There is an enchanting ski trip, a smattering of pranks and misunderstandings and a touch of suspense, all rendered in expressive and imaginative visual detail. The animation technique is in some ways cruder than the digital dazzle that kids see all the time, but also more soulful. The round, wide-eyed faces of the orphans are not as perfectly detailed as those of their counterparts in some of this movie’s Oscar rivals, but they are enigmatic and individual in ways that are hard to forget." 0.986114558 "Animation" "PG-13" "GKIDS" "" "$31,853 " "$309,766 " "" "189" "3-Oct-03" "" "" NA

His style can best be described as inoffensively resolute: He doesn’t badger, but neither does he back off.
That chummy persistence serves him well in “My Scientology Movie,” an offbeat attempt to illuminate the church’s psychological grip on its members. Denied access or interviews, Mr. Theroux and his director, John Dower, hit on the idea of using actors to recreate the insider practices described by the whistle-blower and former church disciplinarian Marty Rathbun — most notably, the abuse of senior officials at the hands of Scientology’s longtime leader, David Miscavige.
Absent the heft and thoroughness of Alex Gibney’s “Going Clear,” the hilarious precision of “South Park” or the deep-dive empathy of Leah Remini’s current television exposé, “My Scientology Movie” relies on a shaggy, meandering charm. At times it plays like an extended skit on “The Daily Show”; yet its disorder also makes its insights — like how strongly the church’s training sessions resemble acting classes — feel refreshingly organic.
Dogged throughout by irate church representatives, Mr. Theroux exhibits an amiable diffidence that dilutes their threats, employing their own jargon (“He seems enturbulated”) to reveal them as more silly than sinister. The same cannot be said of the rather unnerving Mr. Rathbun, whose coaching of the actors seems to release a personality that’s much missed and usually hidden.

As a British intelligence officer during World War II, Mr. Lewis was stationed in Naples after the Allied Forces’ invasion of nearby Salerno in September 1943. An able translator, he helped the military communicate with the civilian population.
On the evidence of the film, he also served as a remarkable chronicler of life in the occupied city. His plain-spoken yet poetic sentences (“Now the statues are disappearing from the public squares, and one cemetery has lost most of its tombstones”) are read in voice-over by Benedict Cumberbatch, and the fluid editing skillfully illustrates his words with disparate material — a mix that includes archival footage and movies like Roberto Rossellini’s “Paisan,” Mike Nichols’s “Catch-22” and Liliana Cavani’s “The Skin.”
This aesthetic choice — along with useless snippets of an actor, not clearly identified as such, playing Mr. Lewis as an old man returning to the city — doesn’t always seem fitting. You may at times wonder if Mr. Lewis, who died in 2003, would have chosen some of these clips. But the selection does lend an effective visual dimension to Mr. Lewis’s tales of wartime strife in the city. We hear of a lack of food and clean water; how Neapolitans resorted to prostitution and to buying goods on the black market; and how disease ran rampant through the city, taking it back to an almost medieval state. Mr. Lewis remembers the devastation of delayed-action explosive devices left by the Germans and the “slag heap” from the eruption of Vesuvius, just southeast of Naples, in March 1944.
It’s also a story of camaraderie; among Mr. Lewis’s Neapolitan friends was a man who made money posing as a fancy uncle from Rome at funerals. But colorful details like that don’t change the sense that “Naples ’44” is essentially an abridged version of a much more detailed work.

The story, written and directed by David Bezmozgis based on his own book, is set among the Russian immigrant population in the suburbs of Toronto, where a 16-year-old, Mark (Alex Ozerov of “The Americans”), delivers drugs for a local dealer while his clueless parents (Deanna Dezmari and Genadijs Dolganovs) nag him to get a job. Mark’s summer is disrupted, to say the least, when an uncle imports a bride (Aya-Tatyana Stolnits) from Russia.
She arrives with her 14-year-old daughter, Natasha (Sasha K. Gordon, whose performance makes this film). Natasha speaks no English, hates her mother and is resentful about having been uprooted.
Mark is assigned to show the morose girl around. She begins to thaw, then turns white hot, first revealing to Mark an ugly past that included having been used by a pornographer, then seducing him.

Otherwise, this narrative feature debut from Camille Thoman is mostly a frustrating jumble of surreal puzzle pieces that audiences will likely be uninterested in solving.
Not that a solution even seems possible. Apparently aiming for an open-ended psychological thriller, Ms. Thoman focuses so fiercely on atmosphere that her narrative isn’t just opaque, it’s a confounding collision of signifiers and symbols. At their center is Miranda (Mireille Enos), an unraveling New York City artist whose work involves invading the privacy of strangers.
“You did a bad thing,” her latest victim complains when she builds an exhibit from information purloined from his cellphone. Bad things are something of a habit: When her married lover (Mr. Shepard) sees a violent assault on the street beneath her window, she tells the police — echoing the plot of Curtis Hanson’s 1987 thriller, “The Bedroom Window” — that she was the witness. Stalking a man she recognizes from a police lineup (Goran Visnjic), her behavior grows increasingly paranoid and unhinged. Is she preparing a new art installation, or is someone trying to kill her?
If only we cared. Ms. Enos is a credibly fraying voyeur, all anxious looks and nervous starts, but “Never Here” is too emotionally antiseptic to engage. That leaves all the heavy lifting to Sebastian Wintero’s moody, nocturnal cinematography, perfectly paired with James Lavino’s dissonant original score.

If, that is, politically motivated shootings and bombings in big cities were fantastical tropes or metaphorical conceits, like zombie epidemics or extraterrestrial invasions. But perhaps “interesting” is too strong a word. Without a real-world correlative for the actions it depicts, Bertrand Bonello’s new film would merely be tedious and pretentious rather than repellent.
There is no denying that Mr. Bonello, whose previous films include “House of Pleasures” (a prurient peek behind the scenes at an early-20th-century bordello) and “Saint Laurent” (a salacious tour of ’70s couture), possesses cinematic skill and suavity to spare. The story told in “Nocturama” splits neatly into before and after, with a few flashbacks thrown in for clarity and variety. The first half follows a collection of young French people as they prepare to carry out a series of attacks in Paris; the second stays with them in the immediate aftermath, as they kill time in a high-end department store.
Part 1 is fast-moving and suspenseful, Part 2 languorous and luxuriant. The young terrorists are brisk and businesslike until the plastic explosives detonate. Then they act out a parody of jaded consumerist hedonism, browsing among the brand names. Nike, Fendi, Issey Miyake — Mr. Bonello places the products so lovingly in the frame that you might think he was being paid to do it.
Really, though, all he advertises is the vacuity of his imagination, which he mistakes for the moral emptiness of his characters and the society that spawned them. They are not — or not all — drawn from its margins or its oppressed groups. A few of the conspirators (there are eight in all, plus an inside man at the store) seem to be children of immigrants from suburban housing projects. The others come from France’s middle and upper classes. One of the leaders is a student at an elite university, with family connections to the minister of the interior, whose office is among the group’s targets.
Other targets include the chief executive of a bank, a row of parked cars, a gilded equestrian statue and a skyscraper with the word “global” conveniently displayed near its crown. The cause that motivates this violence is never specified. One member of the gang is a Muslim who doesn’t drink alcohol and believes he will be welcomed in paradise as a martyr, but religious extremism doesn’t seem to be part of the overall agenda. Nor does any recognizable political ideology or economic grievance. “It was bound to happen,” a bored-sounding young woman says to a perpetrator who has wandered out for a cigarette.
Her fatalism mirrors the nihilism behind the act, and also the chilly abstraction that characterizes Mr. Bonello’s approach to a potentially volatile subject. As they try on fancy clothes and fiddle with wide-screen televisions and top-of-the-line sound equipment, the young rebels prove themselves to be perfect citizens of the system they supposedly hate. They don’t really want to overthrow it or force it to change, but rather to make some noise, to feel as if they’ve done something.
An older generation of French radicals used to speak of the “propaganda of the deed” — the idea that violent or disruptive action can function as a vehicle of political meaning. Today’s terrorists are partly the inheritors of this notion, sending dramatic, lethal messages to enemies and sympathizers alike. For Mr. Bonello’s cadre of good-looking militants, deeds are more like marketing slogans, expressions of a free-floating aesthetic of tedium and mild stimulation.
He treats them with a mixture of solicitude and detachment that reveals its cruelty by degrees. The closer they come to their inevitable bloody end, the more human these mixed-up kids appear. We learn their names, and see evidence of tenderness and folly as well as steely heartlessness. They’re so normal! But that revelation is really just confirmation of Mr. Bonello’s shallow cynicism, his facile conviction that he has built a trap for the audience’s conscience rather than a useless, self-consuming artifact. When the ruthless, faceless power of the state finally asserts itself, what is meant to be a shocking climax merits little more than a nod and a shrug. What took so long?

Detachment may be our survival mechanism, but for Nori Sharif, a young father of four and a dedicated medic in an emergency hospital not far from Baghdad, it’s a luxury he can’t afford. And when he’s handed a small video camera by his director and asked to film his life, the resulting diary of perseverance and suffering has a raw immediacy that’s both appropriate and involving.
The look is rough, the emotions always hovering near the surface. Yet, buoyed by Mr. Sharif’s cheery personality, these can sometimes be defiantly upbeat.
“Have you been injured before?” he asks a patient, who answers no. “Then you are not from Iraq,” he says, smiling. Moments like this are few, though, as he documents the rising tide of danger and displacement that follows the 2011 withdrawal of coalition forces and the eventual arrival of the Islamic State. Throughout, his director (who was born and raised in Iraq and has been observing families in the region for years) maintains a determinedly hands-off approach. This allows Mr. Sharif’s bewilderment over what he calls “an undiagnosed war” to become the story, one that speaks specifically to the profoundly destabilizing nature of lengthy conflict.
It also permits us to honor those whose spirits appear indestructible.

All you need to know is that the heroes, the Straw Hat pirates, are seagoing adventurers on a planet dominated by a world government. The pirates don’t loot vessels; they simply seek lost treasure. (The series title comes from the name of a trove in the first installment.)
In “Gold,” we are fleetingly introduced to these youthful buccaneers, seemingly plucked from disparate movie genres: Zoro is a swordsman; Chopper, a cute, cartoony reindeer evoking a Pokémon; Sanji, a ladies’ man; Franky, a cyborg; Usopp, a sniper; Brook, a skeleton. Their volatile leader, Luffy, can stretch and enlarge his body, like Plastic Man; his sentences almost always end in multiple exclamation points. The female members — Nami, a cat burglar, and Robin, an archaeologist — are eye-roll-inducingly buxom.
The frantic plot concerns the Straw Hats’ visit to Gran Tesoro, a six-mile-long floating casino and entertainment complex impervious to government intervention, and run by the perfidious mastermind Gild Tesoro. Gamblers become starving indentured servants, and the Straw Hats liberate them in escalating battles rendered with a crude line and an often, well, golden palette.

If only Joseph Kosinski’s action-drama “Only the Brave” — based on the exploits of the real-life Granite Mountain Hotshots, a troop of elite firefighters near Prescott, Ariz. — had a less generic title and fewer formulaic beats. But under its slick, schematic surface, this tale of aspiration and redemption at least offers moments of genuine feeling.
This is a movie about Southwestern working-class men who drink beer, carry heavy tools, train in quasi-military fashion, banter in a weight room, attend a group family picnic and drive pickup trucks to a soundtrack loaded with AC/DC and ZZ Top. The women in their lives raise children (or train horses) when they’re not scolding their men about neglecting family or the risks of their profession. Amid the familiar milieu, however, there are subtle, inventive touches.
The more aspirational narrative concerns Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin, whose craggy face has never better blended with a parched setting). Marsh is determined to whip the Hotshots into an efficient unit, despite challenges from his forthright wife (a vivid Jennifer Connelly, whose impassioned arguments with Mr. Brolin’s character have their own kind of spark). Marsh, a bespectacled Buddhist in recovery from substance abuse, is a fascinating variation on your typical taciturn hero. (As his avuncular mentor, a veteran fire chief, Jeff Bridges embodies a more conventional template.)
The redemption concerns a feckless pothead (Miles Teller) whose pregnant girlfriend has left him because of his indigence and dissolution. He must win her back and prove himself a responsible, loving father. The Hotshots help, though he must contend with a ne’er-do-well (Taylor Kitsch) with his own immaturity issues.
Mr. Kosinski — and the screenwriters, Ken Nolan (“Black Hawk Down”) and Eric Warren Singer — let the characters grow in complexity before they face their greatest trial.

Scott Eastwood and Freddie Thorp play Andrew Foster and Garrett Foster, car-thief brothers and ostensibly lovable rogues whose outlandish attempt to purloin a magnificent Bugatti runs them afoul of a pair of psychopathic rival car collectors in Marseille.
Mr. Eastwood is the youngest son of Clint Eastwood. Now in his early 30s, Scott is around the age his father was when playing the amiable cowboy Rowdy Yates in the television series “Rawhide.” The younger Eastwood’s resemblance to his father, and similarity in manner, is such that it sometimes feels as if a younger version of Clint has been digitally spliced into this picture.

By the time the final meal is devoured, you’ll be wanting nothing so much as an antacid.
Inspired by similar events in Ms. Coppola’s past, the story fusses around Anne (an overqualified Diane Lane) as she trundles from Cannes to Paris in an old Peugeot. Anne’s husband, a frantic Hollywood producer (a barely seen Alec Baldwin), has been urgently summoned to Budapest. So his amiable French business partner, Jacques (Arnaud Viard), has offered to drive Anne to her destination — via seemingly every notable restaurant en route.
What follows is a Michelin-starred commercial for French cuisine gussied up as Anne’s journey of self-discovery. When not inhaling jus d’agneau and crème brûlée — and a cheese basket the size of a small fishing boat — the two visit famous landmarks and exchange flirty glances. But when Anne finally peels off her pantyhose, it isn’t to indulge in a roadside quickie; it’s to repair the Peugeot’s broken fan belt. So practical, these American women!
Between promoting her son-in-law’s band and tediously freeze-framing Anne’s amateur snapshots, Ms. Coppola (best known for her riveting 1991 documentary about the making of “Apocalypse Now”) never realizes Anne as more than a bland accessory who lets men tell her what to eat.

The movie begins in West Berlin in 1977, where Sephi (Joy Rieger), an Israeli singer and aspiring composer, performs as a soloist in a choral concert. Afterward, while admiring handsome German fans with a fellow choir member — “30 years ago, they’d be waving ‘Heil,’” Sephi says — she is confronted by a Polish woman (Katarzyna Gniewkowska) who calls her father, now a gynecologist in Jerusalem, a murderer.
Sephi’s sister, Nana (Nelly Tagar), a magazine editor, is eager to investigate. Suddenly, the past is omnipresent. Thomas (Rafael Stachowiak), a West German composer who happens to be the Polish woman’s son, becomes a visiting teacher at Sephi’s Jerusalem music academy, with ambiguous intentions toward her. Nana receives a diagnosis of spleen cancer, which she is convinced is cosmic revenge for a sin their father will not reveal.
Expecting a big surprise might be missing the point. Mr. Nesher, who wrote the screenplay, is less interested in twists than in a broad subject, intergenerational reconciliation.

Their first, “Lone Survivor” from 2013, chronicled an unsuccessful 2005 Navy SEAL mission to kill a Taliban leader in Afghanistan. This year’s “Deepwater Horizon” was about a fatal 2010 disaster involving an oil rig collapse off the Louisiana coast. Now comes “Patriots Day,” about the Boston Marathon bombing of April 15, 2013.
Movies that depict heinous real-life criminal acts and attempt to grapple with their  human toll are provocative undertakings, particularly when they’re made so soon after the actual events. As it happens, “Patriots Day” works so well on a dramatic level that my qualms were silenced almost entirely from the start.
The screenplay, which Mr. Berg wrote with Matt Cook and Joshua Zetumer (Eric Johnson and Paul Tamasy contributed to the story), divides the movie into several story lines focusing on specific individuals. Although Mr. Wahlberg’s character, a police detective who’s working off a suspension by doing uniformed duty at the marathon, is a fictionalized composite, almost all of the other characters — from Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts to the newlyweds played by Rachel Brosnahan and Christopher O’Shea — are based on real people.
Those also include the two bombers, the brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; Tamerlan’s wife, Katherine Russell (Melissa Benoist); and Tamerlan and Katherine’s toddler daughter, Zahira. Their little household is shown squabbling over milk for the baby on the morning of the bombing. This is about as humanizing as the depiction of the terrorists gets.
Themo Melikidze’s Tamerlan emerges as a terse and truculent quasi-fanatic, while Dzhokhar (Alex Wolff) is repellently trivial-minded in his sense of entitlement. When the brothers hijacked a terrified young man’s S.U.V., which they are considering driving to New York to plant more bombs, Dzhokhar’s almost immediate concern is whether it has an iPod dock. The movie’s attitude toward Ms. Russell, who has not been accused or charged in connection with the bombings, is very aggressive, and her portrayal by Ms. Benoist is ice-cold and angry. (This is likely to prove controversial, most specifically with Ms. Russell’s lawyers.)
“Patriots Day” declines even to consider the jihadist ideology that apparently motivated the brothers — indeed, in an aside between F.B.I. agents and local law enforcement, it strongly suggests that Tamerlan’s motivations were largely personal. Instead, the movie focuses on the community that the bombings intended to tear apart, and how Boston and its surrounding towns came together, imperfectly but with a steely determination, to apprehend the culprits.
Shot and edited in a docudrama style that’s a little less frenetic than is conventional, “Patriots Day” is at its best as a vivid re-creation of the measures and resources needed to conduct investigations of such catastrophic crimes. The police get their backs up slightly when the F.B.I. team led by Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) shows up, and the film is frank in its depiction of what can fall through the cracks as well as what can be accomplished when multiple agencies try to collaborate.
All the players here are good, but those in the roles of law enforcement parties — Mr. Wahlberg, Mr. Bacon, John Goodman, J. K. Simmons and Jake Picking among them — are particularly convincing. The movie also provides, especially in a firefight scene between the brothers and the police, a simultaneously bracing and dispiriting account of just how much havoc a pair of heavily armed moral weaklings can wreak when they are so determined. The film also has a longer-than-usual coda featuring interviews with the real figures fictionalized in the movie, which is commendable.

"192" "Patti Cake$" "8/18/2017" "8/17/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/movies/patti-cakes-review.html" 0 "For Patricia Dombrowski, a young New Jersey woman whose many aliases include Killa P and White Trish (and who is played by Danielle Macdonald), hip-hop is not just a musical genre or a cultural style. It’s a universal religion, bringing the promise of grace and salvation into an otherwise drab existence. With a head full of bling-spangled reveries and a notebook full of rhymes, Patti (to use her most common nickname) hones her skills and indulges her dreams with her friend Hareesh (Siddharth Dhananjay), a pharmacist whose nom de mike is Jheri.
“Patti Cake$,” Geremy Jasper’s big-hearted and astute debut film — he wrote, directed and composed the songs that make Patti and Jheri’s aspirations plausible — could have gone wrong in a dozen different ways. The story of a white suburban redhead chasing hip-hop glory may set off alarms about cultural appropriation, but the film mostly disarms them, or mixes them into the soundtrack. “Why don’t you act your age?” Patti asks her mother, Barb (Bridget Everett), an almost-was wannabe stuck in her own rock ’n’ roll fantasies. “Why don’t you act your race?” is Barb’s barbed retort.
Mother and daughter could easily have been figures of mockery. It’s silly of Patti to imagine that she could be the next Nicki Minaj, and pathetic that Barb belts out old radio hits at karaoke. A lot of people in the movie make fun of the Dombrowski women, Patti in particular. Since middle school, she’s been known as Dumbo, and when she enters into an impromptu rap battle with a guy who works at the local pizza place, his rhymes are full of fat-shaming and sexual humiliation. She gives back as good as she gets, and the film, rather than join in the ridicule, registers its cruelty.
But we’re not invited to feel sorry for her either. In structure and attitude, “Patti Cake$” adheres to a template familiar to readers of young adult fiction, blending realism with gentle but unmistakable messages of encouragement. It tells the story of a band of young misfits asserting themselves in a world that refuses to see their value. Jheri and Patti find a beat wizard (and Patti finds a romantic interest) in the person of a taciturn African-American punk rocker (Mamoudou Athie) who lives in a shack near the cemetery and goes by the name of Basterd. The three of them, now called PBNJ, start cutting tracks and planning their assault on the big time. It’s impossible not to root for them.
The older generation comes in for harsher treatment. Wayward parents are a staple of the genre, and Barb wouldn’t place high in a mother-of-the-year contest, but Ms. Everett, a popular cabaret performer and a brilliant actress, endows her with dignity even at her worst. Patti’s grandmother (Cathy Moriarty) gives her more support and earns more sympathy, and also serves as a kind of guarantor of her granddaughter’s decency and ultimate safety. There will be tears, embarrassment and disappointment, but we’re not here to be miserable.
And Ms. Macdonald is quite simply a revelation, capturing the reflexive self-confidence and defensive diffidence of the millennial generation with sneaky sincerity and offhand wit. Though it is expressively shot and crisply edited, the credibility of “Patti Cake$” ultimately rests on her shoulders. We have to believe that Patti is talented, and also that the odds are not in her favor. “It’s a cold world out there,” she’s told by her favorite D.J. (played by MC Lyte), and for us to savor the sweetness of Patti’s creativity we need to feel that chill.
Mr. Jasper at once finds a new variation on a central hip-hop theme and gives a hip-hop inflection to a durable show-business-movie convention.

Arguing poverty, Auralie’s mother and father take her to a beauty-training salon for the procedure, and her-once slack locks, left in tight curlers too long, are majorly poofed. Her hair looks like Bob Dylan’s on the cover of his landmark album “Blonde on Blonde.” That was great for Dylan in 1966 New York, but not so much for an adolescent girl “somewhere in Virginia,” according to a title card, in 1982.
Written and directed by Colette Burson, “Permanent” uses hair and hairstyles as a metaphor for self-worth. Besides Auralie’s unfortunate situation, Jim, a former Air Force One steward now trying to get through med school, is attached to a very unconvincing toupee.

The old-fashioned term “jet set,” with its connotations of glamorous indolence, doesn’t quite fit. Mr. Assayas’s world is populated by figures in perpetual transit: actors, corporate executives, terrorists. Their identities have been dissolved by perpetual displacement. We remember their faces (which are often the faces of movie stars), even if we’re not quite sure who they are.
Maureen, who works as a personal shopper for a spoiled celebrity named Kyra, certainly brushes up against glamour, and occasionally tries on a piece of Kyra’s borrowed couture. But she dwells mostly in a benumbed, stressed-out limbo, in frenzied motion from one nowhere to the next. Her human connections are often mediated by screens. She video-chats with her boyfriend, a tech consultant on assignment in Oman. She exchanges feverish texts with a stranger on a train from Paris to London and back. When asked what she’s doing in Paris, Maureen answers, “I’m waiting.”
What she’s waiting for is a sign from her twin brother, Lewis, whose recent death partly explains his sister’s dazed, blunted affect. If “Personal Shopper,” Mr. Assayas’s new movie, is a supernatural thriller and an unnerving inquiry into the drift and mystery of modern life, it is also a raw and smoldering study in grief.
Kristen Stewart, who plays Maureen, has something in common with other stars of Mr. Assayas’s films, notably Maggie Cheung in “Irma Vep” and “Clean” — a quality of self-enclosed detachment that becomes its own peculiar form of intensity. She possesses an uncanny ability to turn her natural charisma into diffidence. You can’t take your eyes off her, even as she seems to be making every effort to deflect your attention, to obscure her radiance, to disappear onscreen.
In “Clouds of Sils Maria,” Mr. Assayas’s previous film, Ms. Stewart’s character, another celebrity assistant, did vanish. You might say she ghosted. This time she summons ghosts, thanks to a plot contrivance that makes the most of Ms. Stewart’s elusive magnetism. Maureen’s lost brother is not the only one: Other ectoplasmic apparitions make themselves known, and without quite preparing you for it, “Personal Shopper” becomes a sneakily effective horror film, complete with a gruesome murder and Hitchcockian flourishes of menace and misdirection.
Some viewers may balk at Mr. Assayas’s supernatural literalism. Surely he’s too subtle and cerebral a filmmaker for things that go bump in the night. But the hauntedness of contemporary existence — the sense that ordinary experiences of work, sex and travel unfold within invisible networks in response to unseen forces — is a theme he often revisits. His camera moves stealthily, hovering at shoulder level like a stalker or a spy, silently observing people who believe themselves to be alone. The viewer is less a sharer of Maureen’s solitude than an intruder, and the cool allure of “Personal Shopper” is accompanied by a not-unpleasant tingle of voyeuristic shame.
Maureen herself sometimes seems more spectral than physical, even as her bodily presence, slipping in and out of rooms and clothes that don’t belong to her, is the film’s singular constant and the source of its curious emotional power. She is in limbo, caught between worlds, suffering from the disorientation that so often accompanies mourning. Her untethering from reality is echoed in the film’s matter-of-fact departure from realism, and her inertia is the expression of an overwhelming sorrow. “Personal Shopper” is sleek and spooky, seductive and suspenseful. It flirts with silliness, as ghost stories do. And also with heartbreak." 0.872758026 "Drama" "R" "IFC" "" "$79,175 " "$1,305,195 " "" "1" "7-Sep-12" "13-Sep-12" "" NA
"195" "Phantom Thread" "12/25/2017" "12/24/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/24/movies/phantom-thread-review-daniel-day-lewis.html" 1 "Reynolds Woodcock, a couturier plying his trade in London in the 1950s, has a habit of sewing secret messages into his garments. (“Never cursed” is the blessing stitched in lavender thread that he slips into the hem of a wedding gown commissioned by a princess.) These invisible traces of his hand — hidden meanings in the literal sense — signify that his dresses are more than luxurious commodities. They are works of art, obscurely and yet unmistakably saturated with the passion and personality of their creator.
It hardly seems an accident that Paul Thomas Anderson has inscribed his monogram in the title of his eighth feature, “Phantom Thread,” which chronicles a few chapters in Reynolds’s fictional life and career. This is a profoundly, intensely, extravagantly personal film. I don’t mean autobiographical. I know little and care less about the details of Mr. Anderson’s personal life. Whether or not his longtime partner, the actress and comedian Maya Rudolph, has ever cooked him a mushroom omelet is a matter of complete indifference to me.
Not every movie about an artist is a self-portrait of its director, but “Phantom Thread” almost offhandedly lays out intriguing analogies between Reynolds’s métier and Mr. Anderson’s. The fashion designer, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, turns drawings into drama, manipulating color and movement and the human form to construct a material object that is also artificial, idealized and fantastical — a commodity that impersonates a dream. He is assisted in his labor by a crew of disciplined artisans who cut and stitch his ideas into usable form. (This may be the place to note that the editor of “Phantom Thread” is Dylan Tichenor. Mark Bridges designed the costumes. Mr. Anderson served as his own director of photography.)
The result of this collective toil is a singular vessel for beauty and pleasure, subject to the whims of the market and the vagaries of taste and therefore easy to trivialize. It’s just a movie. It’s just a dress. When Reynolds’s sister and business partner, Cyril (Lesley Manville), informs him of the departure of a longtime client for a house she regards as more “chic,” the designer has a small tantrum. The word disgusts him, not least because it expresses the vulgarity of the environment in which he must pursue his lofty visions.
That discrepancy — between an exquisite sensibility and a world of grubby, shallow materialism — may explain some of the temperamental quirks that Reynolds shares with his creator. Over the years, especially since “There Will Be Blood,” Mr. Anderson has repeatedly manifested his indifference to the fashions and conventions of contemporary filmmaking. In particular, he disdains the careful, self-conscious husbanding of themes and messages that preoccupies many of his peers. He always seems more interested in what his movies are than in what they’re about or who they might be for.
“Phantom Thread” is not as hermetic as “The Master” or as loosey-goosey as “Inherent Vice.” It’s a chamber piece, romantic and baroque in equal measure, with arresting harmonies and ravishing changes of tone. (This might be the place to note that Jonny Greenwood composed the score). Like “There Will Be Blood,” it casts Mr. Day-Lewis as an avatar of obsession, driven this time by the pursuit of aesthetic perfection rather than money and power. But whereas Daniel Plainview in the earlier film was a vector of pure, demonic ambition, Reynolds Woodcock bemusedly discovers himself to be one leg of a complicated emotional triangle.
The other sides are Cyril and Alma (Vicky Krieps), a non-British waitress in a provincial British restaurant who becomes Reynolds’s model, mistress and muse. Usually this is a temporary assignment. We briefly meet Alma’s predecessor, Johanna (Camilla Rutherford), who annoys Reynolds at breakfast and is dismissed offscreen by Cyril, with one of Reynolds’s old dresses as a consolation prize. Johanna’s sin is to request some of her lover’s attention, a demand he regards as intrusive and distracting.
That dynamic will repeat itself with Alma, who butters her toast too noisily, pours tea with too much splashing and boldly asserts her right to exist as something more than an ornament in the Woodcock household. The battle of wills that ensues — a two-front war for Alma, who must contend with both Woodcock siblings — is the film’s dramatic furnace and its comic engine. The three main performances are each as richly textured and subtly shaded as the clothes. Mr. Day-Lewis composes a symphony of moods: sardonic, melancholy, inspired, impatient. But he is matched by Ms. Krieps, an actress from Luxembourg as canny and unintimidated as Alma herself. Is this collaboration or competition? A tango or a tennis match? Whatever it is, this partnership is thrilling to watch: funny, wrenching, full of large and small surprises.
The difference between melodrama and comedy is a matter of perspective. Alma, Cyril and Reynolds are all, in their various ways, supremely witty people, capable of underlining the absurdity of their situations with a well-arched eyebrow or a devastating remark. They are acutely sensitive as well. What is painful to them is sometimes funny to us. The reverse is also true.
Like a garment that can be worn with the lining on the outside, “Phantom Thread” reverses itself, almost imperceptibly flipping from Reynolds’s point of view to Alma’s and back again. She succumbs, at first, to what is most likely a well-practiced campaign of seduction: Reynolds flirts with her at breakfast, invites her to dinner, takes her back to his country house and sets about making her a dress. What she regards as her physical flaws — small breasts, broad shoulders, wide hips — he sees as signs of perfection. She is dazzled by his ability to be dazzled by her.
But then, when the spell seems about to wear off, Alma refuses to let it. She rejects the shabby bargain Reynolds offers her, which demands the complete suppression of her will in exchange for his occasional recognition of her existence. “I live here,” she says to a client who might otherwise have assumed she was just another seamstress. She fights for her position in the household, trying to outmaneuver Cyril and to force Reynolds to recognize her as his equal. There is some temerity in this, and some novelty in the way Mr. Anderson depicts their relationship. The wives of artists in movies and literature tend to be doormats or helpmeets, and their psychic anguish and creative fire rarely move from background to center stage.
Is Alma a feminist heroine? Some version of that question is likely to fuel more than a few post-screening arguments. Your answer may depend on what you think of the mushroom omelet that is the movie’s spoiler-proof surprise. There are other things to talk about. On first viewing, the captivating strangeness of the mood and the elegant threading of the plot are likely to hold your attention, but later you can go back to savor the lustrous colors, the fine-grained performances and the romantic mystery that holds the whole thing together.
What kind of love story is “Phantom Thread”? The wrenching tale of a woman’s love for a man and a man’s love for his work. A dry, comic study of the asymmetries and conflicts at the heart of a marriage. A refined gothic nightmare in the manner of Henry James. A perverse psychological fable of unchecked ego and unhinged desire. That’s a partial catalog, and one that can’t quite capture how bizarre this movie is.

In a sprawling home in Punjab, the families of Kanan (Suraj Sharma), a 26-year-old aspiring rapper, and his longtime girlfriend, Anu (Mehreen Pirzada), prepare for their wedding. But Kanan has his doubts — he thinks he might be too young for marriage — and to make matters worse, his family insists he first participate in a ceremony marrying him to a tree. (In this way, he is told, the hapless Kanan can avoid the usual fate of a manglik, a person born “under a cursed star.”)
Soon Kanan is haunted by the glowing ghost of Shashi (Anushka Sharma, no relation to Mr. Sharma), a friendly female spirit only he can see, who has a connection to the tree. His initial terror of, and conversations with, a seemingly nonexistent woman gives his fiancée pause.
Just when you think “Phillauri” is becoming a “Ghost Town”- or “Topper”-type romp, it switches gears, as Shashi imparts her own past. Flash back to almost a century ago, when she was a poet, secretly submitting verse to a newspaper under an assumed name. When she meets another poet, Phillauri (Diljit Dosanjh), a dashing ne’er-do-well, they fall into a love forbidden by Shashi’s pious brother. It’s painful to witness the script’s transformation of Shashi at that point from a hardheaded freethinker into a lovelorn obsessive. But things become worse for her: The abuses of British rule — specifically the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, in Amritsar, Punjab, in 1919 — lead to a dire personal loss.
We shuttle between eras until the threads converge in a present-day supernatural spectacular in Amritsar, attended by a legion of wraiths. Yes, Shashi’s soul finds peace, and Kanan and Anu become ready for marriage. But by then credibility has been drained and the drama has proved exhausting, unhelped by the listless male leads. (Ms. Sharma and Ms. Pirzada bring the spark here.)

The movie under consideration — “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” — is, by contrasts, long and punishing. Its pleasures are so meager, its delight in its own inventions so forced and false, that it becomes almost the perfect opposite of entertainment. To insist otherwise is a variation on the sunk cost fallacy. Since you exchanged money for fun, fun is surely what you must have purchased, and you may cling to that idea in the face of contrary evidence. But trust me on this: This movie would be a rip-off even if someone paid you to see it.
Because, to be honest, it’s barely a movie at all. The first installments of the “Pirates” franchise conquered skepticism with exuberance and charm. Somehow, a theme-park ride combined with clever, madcap visuals and Johnny Depp’s scapegrace showboating added up to something fresh. But that spirit is long gone. Mr. Depp, as Capt. Jack Sparrow, goes through the motions like a washed-up rock star reprising his greatest hits in a half-empty auditorium. The images are so dark and muddy that you can’t see what’s going on well enough to know why you don’t care. The plot twists, Easter eggs and surprises are either obvious or labored. You can’t spoil something that’s already thoroughly rotten.
Now and then you get a reminder of why you might have enjoyed the earlier movies. There are a couple of nifty Rube Goldbergian action sequences — one with a bank vault, the other with a guillotine — that recall the berserk inventiveness of Gore Verbinski, the original director. But otherwise, “Dead Men Tell No Tales,” directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg from a script by Jeff Nathanson, is a tedious rehash.
Two appealing young people (Kaya Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites) meet on a quest for a mysterious and powerful object. They are joined by Sparrow and pursued by old and new enemies: the British Navy; the greedy pirate Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush); and an army of ghouls led by the spectral Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), known as the butcher of the sea.
This goes on for more than two hours. You are invited to sit through every last name on the lengthy end credits for a teasing extra scene of a couple asleep on linen sheets, a reminder of how you might have better spent the time. It would be a spoiler to identify those bedfellows, but the bigger spoiler is that apparently another sequel is on the way." 0.006018927 "Action" "PG-13" "Buena Vista" "$230,000,000 " "$62,983,253 " "$172,558,876 " "" "1,923" "13-Jul-90" "" "" NA

We are reintroduced to the group’s reluctant leader, Beca (Anna Kendrick), as she quits a demeaning record label job. In the same vein, Chloe (Brittany Snow) endures veterinary school, while Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) coasts on her Fat Amy Winehouse impersonation. Discouraged by the demands of the real world, the larger-than-life Bellas reunite to join a U.S.O. tour, where they vie to perform as the opening act for the record producer DJ Khaled (appearing as himself).
With the Bellas removed from their natural collegiate habitat, the a cappella competitions that once drove the series feel out of place. Though there is novelty in casting a contemporary artist like DJ Khaled in the movie’s kingmaker role, his presence is a reminder that the demands of real-world pop are very different from the demands of this franchise’s fantasy version of a cappella. Watching the Bellas mash together pop songs without sound mixing or instruments in Khaled’s presence feels at best obligatory and at worst embarrassing.
“Pitch Perfect 3” fares best when its director, Trish Sie, treats it as a fantastical buddy comedy. A side plot reuniting Fat Amy with her degenerate father (John Lithgow) nearly takes over the movie when Amy’s father kidnaps the Bellas. What follows is the film’s funniest scene, as the suddenly spry Amy, in an attempt to save her friends, refashions sausages into nunchucks and sandwich tinfoil into explosives. In another divergence, the Bellas destroy a hotel suite, releasing a swarm of bees and lighting curtains on fire to the horror of party guests.

It’s unusual to see such excellence in costumes, sets and cinematography lavished on this degree of narrative muddle.
Written by the director, Rebecca Zlotowski, and Robin Campillo — of “The Class” and “BPM (Beats Per Minute),” a recent Cannes prizewinner — this film, mostly set in the 1930s, stars Natalie Portman and Lily-Rose Depp as Laura and Kate Barlow, a spiritualist sister act from the United States. On the Paris stop of their European tour, they give a private séance to a film producer, André Korben (Emmanuel Salinger). As Laura notices, his accent suggests he isn’t from France originally. (Ms. Portman speaks many of her lines in what sounds like credible French.)
André becomes eager to film the mediums at work, with the hope of recording evidence of a spectral presence. (And to paraphrase a professor in the film, cinema — even without actual wraiths — is an invention that captures the ghosts of the future.) André also offers the sisters residence in his home, in an arrangement fraught with class tension.
But much of what happens next — romance, illness — seems arbitrary, as characters come and go without proper introductions.

His specialty has been goofball sweetie-pies: romantics, naïfs, the occasional superhero with a runny nose. So it’s not surprising that as the criminal title character in Rahul Dholakia’s “Raees” — a bootlegger turned kingpin turned politician turned folk hero — he’s more populist do-gooder than villain, a man whose heart is mostly gold, tarnished but unmistakable.
Set in Gujarat, in the 1980s and ’90s, the movie depicts an India of petty corruption, with cops and politicians on the take, and honor among thieves more aspirational than real. “This world is broken,” Raees says in voice-over. “You have to turn crooked to fix it.” And so he does, in a time-honored movie way. In one scene, he beats up a derelict factory owner at a drive-in, as the big screen shows Amitabh Bachchan, Hindi cinema’s original Angry Young Fix-It Man, threatening a boss who is careless with workers’ lives.
Avoiding flabby subplots, Mr. Dholakia keeps “Raees” taut and suspenseful, even at two and a half hours, though it probably has a song too many. (A classic Item Girl number, with Sunny Leone, seems torn between leering and being frank about the sexual threat inherent in … leering.)
Raees is a Muslim with ecumenical good will: He sends meals to Hindu families in need as well as Muslims. And he has a stated belief that “no faith is greater than business.” But in real life, business can have borders — some drawn, like India and Pakistan’s, by faith. Indian film producers voted last year not to employ Pakistanis, and Pakistan has banned Indian shows. That means Mahira Khan (no relation to Shah Rukh), the Pakistani actress making her Hindi movie debut as Raees’s wife, has been barred from promoting the film in India, and it won’t be shown in Pakistan.

Scenes in which the main figures — a ragtag, argumentative but largely cheerful batch of Chinese guerrillas intent on sabotaging the Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War — strategize over meals or regroup in a cave after an attack are pleasantly reminiscent of this genre’s offerings from Asia in the 1970s and early ’80s, period pieces or not. And, of course, there’s Jackie Chan, the performer who’s the sound era’s heir to Buster Keaton.
At 62, Mr. Chan doesn’t mount the kind of jaw-dropping, death-defying stunt work that he used to do (nor should he be expected to). He nevertheless remains an impressive physical performer. Clever and resourceful, he’s found a new way into the action: Instead of driving it, he now dazzles us by sidestepping it. In a fight scene atop a moving train, Mr. Chan lets younger stuntmen jump and fly and punch while the star himself finds elegant methods of getting out of their way.
But beyond Mr. Chan’s deft work here, “Railroad Tigers,” directed by Ding Sheng, is kind of a mess. It opens as if it were a kid’s film, then applies a light slapstick touch to a “let’s take out the railroad bridge” scenario that gets harder to maintain as the casualties mount. The movie’s contempt for its Japanese characters reaches a peculiar culmination in a scene in which ritual suicide is played for laughs.

Years after the book came out in 1951, Hollywood was still pursuing it. “Elia Kazan and Billy Wilder keep calling,” J. D. Salinger’s literary agent Dorothy Olding (Sarah Paulson) says in “Rebel in the Rye.”
“Tell them no. And to stop calling,” he replies, briskly.
Salinger’s disinclination stemmed from disappointment over the film “My Foolish Heart” (1949), based on his story “Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut.”
Filmmakers are still eyeing “The Catcher in the Rye,” but Salinger’s estate is holding the line. Danny Strong, making his directorial feature debut, won some kind of lottery in getting the rights to a critical biography by Kenneth Slawenski. Mr. Strong seizes on the idea of Holden Caulfield as a Salinger alter ego and runs hard with it.
While “Rebel in the Rye” isn’t quite as bad as its pile-of-bricks-clunky title suggests, it’s both simple- and literal-minded, less concerned with Salinger’s consciousness or sensibility than with his ostensible ontological status as a Tortured Creative Giant. Its depiction of Salinger’s probable PTSD, the product of his service in World War II, is almost insultingly hackneyed. When he discovers meditation through an Indian guru, the score, by Bear McCreary, comes alive with tablas and sitars. And so on.
Nicholas Hoult plays Salinger with keen timing and palpable commitment, yet seems respectfully removed from the role.

The cinematography isn’t the greatest, and the structure is hit or miss, but so what? In a movie this good natured, the heart is everything.
The performances are hilarious, but the dancing is no joke. As Gia Kourlas, a dance critic for The New York Times, points out, it takes exceptionally strong technique to merge classical choreography and comedy. Achieving what James Whiteside, a principal dancer for American Ballet Theater, calls “a balance between high art and clever camp” requires endless rehearsal and often physical therapy. Hoisting a 150-lb. man aloft is not for the weak-kneed.
Born from the dust of the Stonewall riots in the 1970s (the name is a homage to the legendary Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo), the company was initially blackballed by financiers and quickly learned to survive on a budget. Leading us lightly through that history, the artistic director and the movie’s unofficial narrator, Tory Dobrin, describes the devastation of AIDS and the relief of creating a space where dancers could forge their own identities. Giving the middle finger to classical ballet was just gravy.
Filming for four years, Ms. Hart follows a handful of touching individual stories and takes us on the road (the Trocks, as they are known, are rock stars in Japan), a punishing travel schedule that gobbles up more than two-thirds of the year. Oxygenating almost every scene, though, is the men’s delight in being liberated from the gender restrictions of traditional ballet — a freedom that allows them to create art that’s uniquely their own." 0.995349664 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Icarus Films" "" "$3,530 " "$55,366 " "$24,174,831 " "2,612" "21-Sep-07" "15-Nov-07" "56" 8

At one point in “Reset,” the riveting documentary by Thierry Demaizière and Alban Teurlai that chronicles Mr. Millepied choreographing a new ballet, he grabs an injured dancer’s foot and vigorously massages the heel. “Softer is pointless,” he says, ignoring her whimpers.
Mr. Millepied, the choreographer for the Darren Aronofsky film “Black Swan” (where he met his wife, Natalie Portman) and former principal at New York City Ballet, doesn’t do soft. He may be French, but in “Reset,” Mr. Millepied — brash, funny, intelligent — is very much an American living in Paris. And most of us already know the job didn’t work out in the end: Last year he announced his resignation as director of dance there.
It’s hard to make changes at the bureaucratic Paris Opera, yet Mr. Millepied — something of a real-life Rodrigo from “Mozart in the Jungle” — weathers it all with cheerful tenacity. He can be elusive, especially to his assistant, who is continually asking, “Have you seen Benjamin?” In one meeting, she rattles off his list of appointments; he turns to the camera with a hand covering his mouth and says: “Look at her diary. She’s going to kill me.”
But “Reset” also fleshes out the creative process and shows how, for Mr. Millepied, pleasure must always be part of dance.

Anderson, is an exceptional talent in action cinema, and because their star, Milla Jovovich, is a charismatic, exceptional and very credibly kinetic action performer, the movies in the “Resident Evil” franchise, of which this is the sixth, have always been a terrific time. Provided you like that sort of thing — that sort of thing being post-apocalyptic and necessarily grim sci-fi mayhem adapted from a popular, genre-mashing video game.
In “Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,” Ms. Jovovich’s Alice, a virally superpowered avenger on behalf of a highly diminished human population, is assisted by her onetime nemesis the Red Queen, an artificial intelligence program that takes the holographic form of a young girl. Deep in “the Hive” of Raccoon City, where all the “Resident Evil” trouble began, is a vial that can save humanity. A time-sensitive gauntlet is laid down, and the never-ending action begins.
There’s some really hair-raising stuff here, including a rain-of-fire set piece for which Mr. Anderson’s last film, “Pompeii,” might have served as a kind of dress rehearsal. Among Alice’s foes are hordes of flesh-eating undead, and it’s to Mr. Anderson’s credit that even in a pop culture glutted with postmodern zombies, he can make his creatures startle viewers. But the blindingly fast cuts and the inflated reprises of the franchise’s greatest hits — the startling undead Dobermans of the first film are back — yield diminishing returns. This is, I think, the weakest picture in the franchise.
Nevertheless, the movie percolates enough that even when, at its climax, it shamelessly recycles a grisly punch line from 1987’s “RoboCop,” it’s kind of endearing, not least because Mr. Anderson and company make it work." 0.953235679 "Action" "R" "Sony / Screen Gems" "$40,000,000 " "$13,601,682 " "$26,830,068 " "" "1,148" "3-Oct-86" "" "" NA

That’s a rather melodramatic utterance, especially from a ballerina past the age when most retire. When Wendy Whelan, who has been called “America’s greatest contemporary ballerina,” says it in the documentary “Restless Creature: Wendy Whelan,” she undercuts the sentiment, acknowledging how ridiculous she might sound.
Still, she means it. Dance is her life. And her disarming combination of humility and honesty, making light of heavy emotions without concealing their true weight, has much to do with how this affecting film portrait can sneak up on you.
Directed by Linda Saffire and Adam Schlesinger, “Restless Creature” captures Ms. Whelan in 2013 at 46, as she’s struggling to recover from a potentially career-ending injury and facing pressure to give her final bows at New York City Ballet after nearly 30 years there. Following her as she begins to reinvent herself as a dancer outside of ballet, the film is both a comeback story and, more profoundly, a coming to terms with aging.
“Restless Creature” is tightly edited but patient, with as many uneventful scenes of physical therapy and cocktail parties as more dramatic footage of surgery and is-she-pushing-too-hard suspense. Ballet dancers are experts in masking pain. But through trust established between the filmmakers and Ms. Whelan, this film allows us to see her stoic control, her superhuman strength under pressure, and also to see through it — to the self-doubt, the fear of losing her very identity.
Ms. Whelan, who escaped injury for most of her career, says that she has lived her whole life in “a fantasy world,” believing she would never break. Grow up, she chides herself.
While recognizing the psychological truth in that self-assessment, the film discreetly complicates it with Ms. Whelan’s biography. (The X-ray of her 12-year-old spine, bent into an S-curve by scoliosis, is no fantasy image.) By the end, it’s easy to understand the judgment of a colleague that this anti-diva changed the profession.
The plentiful snippets of Ms. Whelan dancing signature roles give a cumulative sense of her gifts. Though a dance fan could wish for more sustained sequences, what comes across is less a performance than a person the viewer has come to know, dancing with people she loves in choreography made for her by friends (who may happen to be Christopher Wheeldon and Alexei Ratmansky). “Restless Creature” humanizes dance.
More remarkable, though, is how the film and Ms. Whelan, without falsification, turn an extreme form of midlife crisis into a heartening tale. “Restless Creature” makes the potential compensations of age seem as beautiful as any ballet." 0.964747297 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Abramorama" "" "$3,716 " "$18,415 " "$2,745,871 " "2,469" "1-Aug-14" "18-Sep-14" "" NA

For one thing, by the time this one’s over, fans will know a lot more about the mysterious Samara, the dead girl who continues to terrify the living via a grainy videotape. And those nearing or in college — the demographic being aimed at here — will learn an important lesson: Beware of any professor who tries to recruit you for a research study.
In case you’ve forgotten, the foundation of the franchise is a short videotape full of unsettling images that unsuspecting people keep stumbling upon; anyone who watches it dies seven days later. The original Japanese film, by Hideo Nakata, was an influential hit, and the 2002 American version was pretty successful, too, boosting the career of its star, Naomi Watts. (“The Ring Two,” in 2005, didn’t do as well.)
There is no Ms. Watts in “Rings,” directed efficiently by F. Javier Gutiérrez, but there is a heroine in jeopardy, Julia, played by Matilda Lutz. Julia’s boyfriend, Holt (Alex Roe), has gone off to college and been sucked into a research project by Gabriel (Johnny Galecki, of “The Big Bang Theory”), a professor who accidentally acquired the lethal videotape at a flea market. Gabriel has realized that the curse can be beaten if, during the seven-day period, the afflicted person gets someone else to watch the tape, and so his research is predicated on a sort of lethal pyramid scheme.
Julia is determined to rescue Holt at any cost; Vincent D’Onofrio makes an embarrassing appearance as a blind cemetery caretaker; and Samara (Bonnie Morgan) is given a full back story. The death-by-VCR conceit has been pretty thoroughly exhausted at this point, imitation being the sincerest form of flattery — see, for instance, “Beyond the Gates,” which came out in December. So this film doesn’t find any fresh ways to make you jump out of your seat.
Ms. Lutz is appealing, though, and fans of the franchise will probably be pleased with the elaboration.

Even so, it feels unfinished in a way that is at once fascinating, frustrating and entirely understandable. The story Ms. Poitras has to tell is still unfolding, and opinions about the person at its center — the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange — continue to evolve.
Much of the film casts a weirdly nostalgic spell, as it transports the audience back to a recent moment in history that nonetheless seems very far away. From 2010 to 2013, when most of the interviews in “Risk” were conducted, Mr. Assange emerged as a glamorous and controversial figure, a media-savvy and politically astute champion of radical transparency dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct.
WikiLeaks, which specialized in the highly publicized release of huge troves of classified documents and communications, challenged governments and journalistic conventions. The organization and its allies seemed to be on the vanguard of a global movement toward openness and democracy, enabled by digital technology and fueled by the idealism and skepticism of an army of hackers.
Things look different now. The connotations of the word “hacker” have darkened, and so, perhaps, have perceptions of the digital future. This is partly because the political and media context — and indeed the apparent direction of history — have changed dramatically. Remember Barack Obama’s first term? Remember the Arab Spring? Remember social media before the trolls and fake-news hucksters took it over?
“Risk” will take you back, briefly, to that era. It is possible to imagine circumstances — a different result in the 2016 presidential election, say, but not only that — in which this movie would be a more or less straightforward prequel to “Citizenfour,” Ms. Poitras’s Oscar-winning documentary about Edward J. Snowden. That film is in a sense tucked inside “Risk,” as Ms. Poitras abruptly leaves London, where she met with Mr. Assange, for Hong Kong, summoned by a message from an anonymous whistle-blower who will turn out to be Mr. Snowden. She sees less of Mr. Assange after that, and you get the impression that he was not altogether pleased with the shift in the filmmaker’s (and the rest of the world’s) attention away from him.
It would be simplistic to describe “Risk” as the chronicle of Ms. Poitras’s disillusionment with Mr. Assange. She is a discreet and careful observer, inserting herself into the story only when it might seem evasive to do otherwise and refraining from passing judgment on Mr. Assange. But any interesting portrait is necessarily the record of a relationship between artist and subject, each of whom is invested in controlling the outcome. And to some degree in spite of Ms. Poitras’s journalistic intentions — though very much as a consequence of her rigorous honesty — the picture that emerges is complicated, unsettling and intriguingly ambivalent.
“Why does he trust me?” Ms. Poitras asks in one of the voice-over diary entries that punctuate “Risk.” “I don’t think he likes me.” That is hard for the viewer to judge, since the filmmaker doesn’t appear on camera and her subject does not exactly exude warmth. But the trust is evident in his candor and in the remarkable access she was granted, both in the estate in Norfolk, England, where Mr. Assange was confined during his period of house arrest and in the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he sought asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden.
With weary impatience, Mr. Assange describes the sexual assault allegations against him as the product of a feminist conspiracy. “Risk” takes them seriously, and sheds light on the ugly thread of misogyny and predation that runs through so much of the tech world — in Silicon Valley executive suites as well as in gamer message boards and hacker collectives — and that has been dismissed or denied for far too long.
The movie also examines — not always explicitly, and not entirely by design — the workings of a contemporary personality cult. Mr. Assange, who muses on his “god complex” and his capacity for martyrdom, likes to surround himself with disciples. Fidelity to the message melts into loyalty to the messenger, even if the message itself can sound a bit blurry. In one interview, Mr. Assange explains the need to balance principles and pragmatism, and in another he speaks of the necessity of a global outlook in trying to change the world. But he demurs when asked about the changes he would like to see come about, and never arrives at a clear articulation of principle. He insists on transparency while choosing to remain opaque.
It is appropriate, though not entirely satisfying, that “Risk” ends in a swirl of confusion. Events since Cannes have upended many of the arguments that the film might have clarified. The pressing empirical questions about Mr. Assange now have to do with the extent and nature of his intervention in the election. Those questions — about Russia, the F.B.I. and members of the Trump campaign — can’t yet be answered by a movie, much less a movie review. And the deeper historical and ideological questions that the film poses will also take a long time to work out.

And an appealingly nasty wolf, too.
Bodi (the voice of Luke Wilson) is a mastiff who — as all young animated characters must — chafes at his assigned role in life, which is to guard the sheep on Snow Mountain. Blame radio. He has accidentally come into possession of one, and the music he hears on it makes him long to try the rock ’n’ roll life.
He’s especially enamored of Angus Scattergood, a legendary rocker whose voice is provided by Eddie Izzard in a delightful performance. Bodi leaves Snow Mountain and largely by accident makes his way to Angus’s mansion, whose excessive security features are a comic high point of the film.
As Bodi pursues his dream, a pack of wolves pursues him; grown-ups will enjoy hearing the distinctively enraged voice of Lewis Black as the head wolf. The film, based on a Chinese graphic novel and directed by Ash Brannon, keeps its animation simple and its story lines clear, which makes it reliable fare for the 10-and-younger set.

"11/22/2017" "11/16/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/movies/roman-j-israel-review-denzel-washington.html" 0 "Partly because of economics, partly because of a lack of imagination, Hollywood barely makes character-driven movies anymore. So there is a sense in which “Roman J. Israel, Esq.,” a wildly idiosyncratic drama about a wildly idiosyncratic lawyer, deserves not only critical leniency, but also maybe your investment.
Yet this film doesn’t do the cause many favors. It certainly doesn’t serve Denzel Washington, in a role unlike any he has played that nevertheless saddles him with a collection of tics meant to compensate for the underrealized complexity of the part. And it offers tonal whiplash for viewers, with several potentially great ideas that don’t settle into a coherent whole. The movie starts in the vein of a ruthlessly intelligent drama like “Michael Clayton” before racing through adversity, running a couple of unearned victory laps and landing just shy of a mawkish Will Smith vehicle like “Seven Pounds.”
The film was written and directed by Dan Gilroy, whose “Nightcrawler” centered on Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a monomaniacal cameraman whose lack of a moral compass allowed him to succeed in local television news. Roman Israel (Mr. Washington) is equally single-minded in his pursuits, but otherwise he’s Lou’s opposite: a hapless striver whose compulsions interfere with his ambitions.
Roman keeps to his office in a small Los Angeles firm. He is a whiz with briefs and apparently knows the legal code by number, but his partner is always the one who appears in court, having more tolerance for what Roman calls the “butchery” of plea deals and excessive sentences. When the partner has a heart attack, Roman, who can’t run the firm alone or stop himself from talking back to a judge, eventually takes a job with George Pierce (Colin Farrell), a high-flying lawyer who doesn’t necessarily share Roman’s ideals.
A veteran social reformer with a dated hairstyle and glasses that only exaggerate his awkwardness, Roman is almost certainly somewhere on the autism spectrum. In a performance that’s meant to grate, Mr. Washington highlights the character’s difficulty making eye contact and his habit of laughing and smiling with too much emphasis. As intriguing as it is to watch a movie about someone who is gifted yet hamstrung by his own mind, you do wonder whether — after Roman and Lou — Mr. Gilroy is capable of writing protagonists who aren’t so affectedly at odds with their environments.
The fish-out-of-water clash at the firm is absorbing enough, but the movie misfires when it appoints Roman as a sort of an angelic figure (or, as his last name may signal, a prophet). Carmen Ejogo appears as a younger civil rights advocate who, unlike the other activists we meet from her generation, recognizes Roman’s past contributions and explains that she feels privileged to know him. Roman even begins to grow on George, who inexplicably warms to him just as Roman is wreaking havoc at the firm. And when Roman makes not one but two symbolic getaways — one to Santa Monica, one to the desert — “Roman J. Israel, Esq.” seems like a movie that has no idea where it’s heading.
While “Nightcrawler” delivered its bludgeoning lecture on TV sensationalism about four decades too late, “Roman J. Israel, Esq.” goes oddly easy on the cruel bureaucracy of the legal system. Either Roman is too pure for the world of this movie or he is not.

In a different language, a different time period.”
Mr. Clark is part of RAW Talent, a group of young people who write and perform poetry. The members decided to stage their own team-written script loosely adapted from “Romeo and Juliet,” and Jason Zeldes, the director of this documentary, “Romeo Is Bleeding,” followed along to learn about their lives and chart their progress (a plan similar to that of several films, including “Shakespeare High” and “The Hobart Shakespeareans”).
Mr. Zeldes, who with Kevin Klauber also edited the documentary, uses fast cuts, varied camera angles and a patchwork of scenes to take in the varied perspectives of life in Richmond. The filmmakers walk with residents, ride with police officers and hear stories of young men who’ve been killed.
This free-flowing style mimics the hip-hop and jazz-inflected rhythms of the student-poets. But it comes at a price; the portraits drawn of these young people frequently feel half-finished. As soon as a story or a profile turns compelling, the movie switches to another topic.
For long stretches, “Romeo Is Bleeding” jettisons talk of Shakespeare altogether, though the real center of the film is, as it should be, the program members. They stay passionate despite discouraging circumstances. In Mr. Clark’s case, he had few options. When asked to join the group, he said, “It was either that or the streets, so I write poetry.”" 0.827853202 "Documentary" "R" "Gramercy" "" "$1,225,737 " "$3,275,585 " "" "2" "2-Jun-06" "24-Aug-06" "77" 11

That’s the question in the soft vanilla comedy “Rough Night,” about five women who blunder into disaster over the course of a carousing bachelorette weekend. If you’ve seen “The Hangover” and its sequels or various other movies of this familiar ilk, you have more or less seen “Rough Night.” There’s even a movie titled “Bachelorette,” another would-be laugh-in about friends who go crazy — snort, snort, snort, chug, chug — until they’re put back on the path toward happily ever after.
In “Rough Night,” Scarlett Johansson stars as Jess and is nearly eclipsed by Kate McKinnon, who plays one of her pals. A politician who’s about to get married, Jess is on the verge of losing a state senate race to an opponent who has pulled ahead with some Anthony Weiner-esque penis pictures. That a competent female politician can’t compete with literal penises suggests that the filmmakers have some ideas in store, something, say, that mines the comedy of our new Neanderthalism, an age partly defined by the reinvigorated war between the sexes and the triumphant rise and occasional fall of male members.
No such luck. The director Lucia Aniello, who wrote the script with Paul W. Downs, soon abandons any pretense that she is going to deliver more than goofs. Instead, she trots out clichés, including a flashback that shows Jess and another bestie, Alice (Jillian Bell), holding their own at a frat blowout. Here, partying hard is meant as a stand-in for equality, which is mighty low stakes on which to build a gender-flipping comedy. Nonetheless, Ms. Aniello barrels ahead with limp penis jokes, yuks and a little upchuck, throwing in a starry guest appearance and the requisite slow-motion wolf-pack shot of the women strolling in a line, an image so stale it’s an entry on tvtropes.org.
It’s all blithely formulaic and would be more irritating if the performers — who include Zoë Kravitz and Ilana Glazer — weren’t generally so appealing. (Ms. Glazer is a star of the Comedy Central show “Broad City,” which Ms. Aniello and Mr. Downs also both work on.) The actors are playing types, not people, but most bring enough natural presence and good will to fill in their characters’ sketchy profiles. It helps, too, that Ms. Johansson and Ms. Glazer are gifted physical performers who can sell weak jokes, though no one steals a show like Ms. McKinnon, a brilliantly versatile comic who reaches Madeline Kahn-levels of eyeball-rolling, eyeball-popping and all-knowing dementedness.
Those eyes get a workout when the women’s weekend takes a detour that’s straight out of “Very Bad Things,” a 1998 comedy about a bachelor party that turns deadly when a reveler accidentally kills a female prostitute. In response, the men embrace their worst instincts, which in this case means they hide one death and, in the process, instigate another. Boys will be boys and sometimes killers — or so “Very Bad Things” cheerfully suggests. “The Hangover” basically packages such rotten male behavior for the mainstream, using a live hooker instead of a dead one and adding Mike Tyson, an errant tiger and a pileup of belabored high jinks. Women scarcely figure in its manly meltdown, which is the point.
“Rough Night” switches the gender lineup from “Very Bad Things” but with less (shallow) philosophizing and heterosexual panic. Much like their “Very Bad” counterparts, the women quickly embrace self-interest, which leads to unfunny gags with an inconvenient corpse. That women can be as deadly or immoral as men isn’t new or interesting, and here it also isn’t all that entertaining. What is notable is that “Rough Night” makes room for the opposite sex (too many comedies are his or hers), specifically with some slow-building nonsense involving Jess’s fiancé (Mr. Downs), who crashes the party in adult diapers — which reads as a nice, sly wink at the comedy of male infantilism.
American comedy has long depended on overgrown baby boys — Lou Costello, Will Ferrell — whose naïveté, entertaining misbehavior or outright stupidity suggests that men are finally as toothless as infants. It’s a convenient fantasy (don’t worry, ladies!), one that has grown less viable as women have gained power and autonomy offscreen. “Rough Night” wants its female characters to get down, dirty and dumb, too, and indulge in their ostensible vices as unapologetically as any Zach Galifianakis boob. That’s cool or might be if the jokes were a lot funnier and if this movie grasped that performing naughtiness is meaningless when men behaving badly is the rule of the land." 0.016820001 "Comedy" "R" "Sony / Columbia" "$20,000,000 " "$8,004,283 " "$22,105,643 " "" "1,218" "3-May-85" "" "" NA

Sharing the same spirit of “20 Feet From Stardom” and “Searching for Sugar Man,” which both put overlooked performers center stage, this film examines the influence of Native Americans on popular music. What at first seems like a thin topic — quick, name two American Indian musicians — becomes a master class in the mixing of cultures.
The survey starts with the guitarist Link Wray, who was Shawnee. Wray “made an indelible mark on the whole evolution of where rock ’n’ roll was going to go,” Robbie Robertson of the Band says. Wray’s 1958 single, “Rumble,” was banned from airplay in several cities amid worries that it would incite teenage gang violence (despite being a wordless, instrumental tune), and Wray’s guitar line seems to echo in every power chord you’ve heard.
Charley Patton, who profoundly shaped the blues, is profiled in another section before the film moves to Mildred Bailey, Jesse Ed Davis, members of the band Redbone and others, all of whom had Indian heritage. We hear about childhoods spent listening and learning from grandparents who passed on traditions, and of discrimination encountered in the broader world. “Be proud you’re an Indian, but be careful who you tell,” Mr. Robertson, who is part Mohawk, says of a prevailing attitude when he was younger.
Shorter sections explore American Indian rhythms and beats that seeped into popular music, and the deep connections the players forged with African-American performers. Newsreels and old black-and-white photos provide historical context, and interviews add plenty of energy. Martin Scorsese and Iggy Pop offer insights, while Steven Van Zandt’s enthusiasm is contagious. After hearing a story by Jackson Browne, you’ll listen to his “Doctor My Eyes” with different ears.
Directed by Catherine Bainbridge, “Rumble” takes a few serious turns even as it remains lively throughout. If you couldn’t name two Native American musicians at the beginning of the documentary, you’ll remember at least a half-dozen after the end. And it’s a good bet you’ll be searching for their albums, too." 0.994758624 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Kino Lorber" "" "" "$226,006 " "" "1" "6-Nov-15" "10-Dec-15" "35" 5

Mr. Lennon (no relation to the “Reno 911!” comedian) enlisted 40 filmmakers in 25 countries to record scenes large and small, and the results are surprisingly cohesive.
You won’t find greedy televangelists or much about militant theocracies here. “Sacred,” comprising three segments, celebrates perhaps the most worthy of religion’s functions: providing ceremonies for rites of passage. “Initiation” concerns birth, glimpsing, among other things, an Ethiopian baptism, a bris in New York City, an Egyptian father’s chanting the call to prayer to his newly born son. “Practice” visits a Hasidic gathering in Ukraine where men meet prospective wives, and follows a married Japanese couple at the Mara Kannon Shrine in Yamaguchi, where phallic statuary is said to promote fertility. In “Passage,” a wizened Ethiopian man ends a pilgrimage for absolution, while a Connecticut woman with emphysema extols the value of prayer.

In the late 1990s, a Dutch couple, Martin Verfondern and Margo Pool, post-hippie types looking to carve out a place for themselves far from the modern-day rat race — to get off the grid, as some say today — found an isolated village there whose name, Santa Eulalia, has over the years been compressed to Santoalla. At the opening of this documentary with the same name, directed by Andrew Becker and Daniel Mehrer, it’s plain that things did not work out as planned for the couple: Home-video footage shows Martin approaching a neighbor who calmly raises the handle of a farm tool and brings it down on the camera, causing the recording to go black.
Ms. Pool narrates this chronicle, talking about how her husband disappeared in 2010, as Mr. Becker and Mr. Mehrer jump around in time. The couple are initially portrayed as sympathetic. Their only neighbors in Santoalla are the Rodriguez family, made up of the quiet patriarch, Manolo (he’s the camera smiter); the chatty, religious wife, Jovita; and their two sons, the voluble Carlos and Julio, who suffers from mental disorders.
At first these families get along reasonably well. As the filmmakers introduce more archival footage, Mr. Verfondern comes across as less laid-back as he initially seemed. His plans for developing his land into some utopian retreat often run afoul of the Rodriguezes, and a dispute over shared forest areas leads to a courtroom battle. Soon the families aren’t even speaking to each other. Then Mr. Verfondern vanishes, seemingly without a trace. At this point the narrative deliberately goes slack as Ms. Pool weighs her options. “Santoalla” ends with the mystery solved.

But “Saving Banksy” has a larger goal: pointedly weighing graffiti’s populist ethos against art-world profiteering.
Graffiti art can be ephemeral: a spray-painted image — until somebody defaces it, or a property owner paints over it — is, at least briefly, free for everyone to behold. Banksy’s public art endures, partly because of extraordinary efforts to salvage it. When the artist visited San Francisco in 2010, his work popped up in various neighborhoods. One artist-collector, Brian Greif, had part of a wall, with Banksy’s rendering of a rat, meticulously carved out of a Victorian building on Haight Street. He seeks a museum that will share it with the public in perpetuity.
Mr. Greif’s effort contrasts with that of Stephan Keszler, an art dealer with a gallery in Southampton, N.Y., who excavates Banksy’s works from public sites and sells them for his own gain. Banksy (who has never revealed his identity) condemns such sales, as does Ben Eine, one of many street artists interviewed here. Mr. Eine says Mr. Keszler is regarded by such painters as “a shyster”; Mr. Keszler, who displayed a few Banksys at Art Miami in 2012, says he enhances Banksy’s reputation.
“Saving Banksy” owns its sympathies: “It’s the poor street kids and the multibillionaires,” Mr. Eine says. “We’re doing everything for nothing, and they’re walking home with Banksys for a million dollars.”" 0.920350306 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Parade Deck Films" "" "$572 " "$8,601 " "$5,617,118 " "20" "10-Jul-09" "13-Aug-09" "35" 5

Neasa Ni Chianain and David Rane’s documentary “School Life” is a loving portrait, primarily, of the inspirational educator couple, who command the respect of their students and always seem to know what a particular child needs to hear.
The movie captures a cross section of life at this progressive boarding school, which enrolls students ages 3 to 13 (although the movie focuses on the elementary schoolchildren). Among other activities, Ms. Leyden directs her students in “Hamlet.” Mr. Leyden, who teaches a range of subjects that include math and Latin, also leads rock band practice. (What well-rounded curriculum doesn’t include group covers of Ellie Goulding?)
These seem like great kids, and their teachers are unflappable, open-minded and apparently good dog owners, too. But while Headfort may offer an aspirational model for schools, such pervasive niceness can come across as repetitive on screen, especially when a film concerns a topic as popular as education, which was explored in documentaries like Frederick Wiseman’s “High School,” Davis Guggenheim’s “Waiting for Superman” and many others.
It’s fair for Ms. Ni Chianain to set sociological context aside, but only on a few occasions — when Mr. Dix leads a classroom debate on same-sex marriage, or Mr. Leyden must figure out how to deal with a new student who has missed band practice — does drama materialize." 0.817545158 "Documentary" "PG-13" "Magnolia" "" "" "$17,351 " "$446,574 " "406" "1-Oct-10" "7-Oct-10" "7" 1

Basquiat died in 1988 of a heroin overdose. This year, a painting of his sold for $110.5 million. Haring died in 1990 of AIDS; his works regularly sell in the low millions. As for Mr. Hambleton, who for years had cancer that he declined to treat, he died recently, in a cheap residence in Chinatown. According to “Shadowman,” a fascinating, harrowing film about his life, he was still painting until he died.
One interviewee posits that death turned out to be a good career move for Basquiat and Haring. Mr. Hambleton, by dint of staying alive, never sold at extravagant prices.
The movie, directed by Oren Jacoby, begins with black-and-white, night-shot video of Mr. Hambleton stalking the Lower East Side, paint can and brush in hand, and making instant silhouettes on building walls. These shadow paintings were different from graffiti, he insisted. They created a sensation, and Mr. Hambleton, who had begun in Vancouver, British Columbia, doing sidewalk “murder paintings” in which chalk outlines of bodies were spattered with blood-red paint, got caught up in the underground arts scene’s attendant vices.
But he never stopped painting, even making works with his own blood on paper during a heroin-driven period when he was living in a single room with two women. Friends and patrons, most of them interviewed here, interceded. Mr. Hambleton got skin cancer and had scoliosis.
In later years, we see him scurrying through his studio’s corridors, practically hunchbacked, a Band-Aid seeming to hold his nose to his face.

And if “Sidemen: Long Road to Glory” is to be believed, most of those highways converge on three bluesmen in particular: the drummer Willie Smith, the guitarist Hubert Sumlin and the pianist Joe Willie Perkins, known as Pinetop.
Germinating and shape-shifting for almost a decade, Scott Rosenbaum’s loving tribute (originally conceived in 2008 as a “Last Waltz”-style concert film) pulls back the big-name curtain to celebrate these often overlooked backing musicians whose riffs and runs are revered to this day. As proof, a slew of sunken-eyed rock legends — including Johnny Winter, Gregg Allman, Keith Richards and Joe Perry — is on hand to share memories of the men and attest to their lasting influence.
But “Sidemen” is about more than just legacy. Blessed with extensive interviews with their buoyant subjects (all three of whom died in 2011 within months of one another), Mr. Rosenbaum and his producer Jasin Cadic shape a narrative of professional insecurity and personal resilience. From playing brothels and juke joints in the Jim Crow South to decades-long collaborations with the Chicago blues pioneers Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, the three weathered careers of astonishing flux.
Their stories are inseparable from that of the blues itself, which the filmmakers illustrate with a wealth of clips and concert footage reaching back more than half a century. The kids who thrilled to the Rolling Stones performing “Little Red Rooster” (the first blues song to reach No. 1 on the British charts), or watched Jimi Hendrix kill “Killing Floor,” probably knew nothing of Wolf and Waters.

"222" "Silence" "1/6/2017" "12/22/2016" "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/movies/silence-review-martin-scorsese.html" 0 "Martin Scorsese’s “Silence” is a story of faith and anguish. It tells of a Portuguese Jesuit priest, Father Rodrigues, who in 1643 heads into the dark heart of Japan, where Christians are being persecuted — boiled alive, immolated and crucified. Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) sets out to help keep the church alive in Japan, a mission that perhaps inevitably leads to God. The film’s solemnity is seductive — as is Mr. Scorsese’s art — especially in light of the triviality and primitiveness of many movies, even if its moments of greatness also make its failures seem more pronounced.
Mr. Scorsese’s work has long involved struggles of faith of one kind or another, from the religious guilt that afflicts Harvey Keitel’s thug in “Mean Streets” (“You don’t make up for your sins in the church.”) through that circle of hell known as “The Wolf of Wall Street.” In “Silence” the struggle begins in a mist-wreathed landscape where severed human heads rest on a crude shelf, like trophies of some ghastly victory. Today, decapitations in the name of religion are a gruesome hallmark of Islamist extremists, but here they introduce a dispute involving the Japanese authorities, who, intent on maintaining the country’s power and isolation, are set on eradicating Christianity, its proselytizers and converts.
Figures soon emerge from the mist, notably Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who, as gaunt and tormented as any martyred Caravaggio saint, watches in gaping horror as guards ladle water from hot springs on shrieking Christians. Rodrigues learns about this hellish scene from Father Valignano (Ciaran Hinds), who also relates that Ferreira has renounced his religion and is living as “a Japanese.” Rodrigues, having studied with Ferreira, refuses to accept that the older priest’s belief has been shattered and departs for Japan accompanied by another priest, Father Garupe (a fine, underused Adam Driver), and a Japanese guide, Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka, excellent).
The movie’s early scenes are filled with severe pictorial beauty as the pale thermal steam snaking around the martyred Christians gives way to the vaulted white room where the black-clothed Jesuits meet. The chromatic contrast between the inkiness of their cassocks and the room’s ascetic whiteness finds an echo in Rodrigues’s rigid dualism, a belief in absolutes that will be tested. His resoluteness even seems answered by the calm camerawork (no jitters here), which early on is dramatically punctuated by a ravishing overhead shot of the three Jesuit priests gliding down a flight of stony, bleach-white stairs, as if they were being looked down on from high above.
Whether this represents God’s vision or that of the priests, it is very much the point of view of the movie’s own creator. This overhead shot and others suggest that there’s a divine aspect to the priests’ mission, an idea that Mr. Scorsese visually and narratively underlines in the Lazarus-like cave in which Rodrigues and Garupe first take shelter in Japan; in Rodrigues’s self-aggrandizing identification with Jesus; and, crucially, through the figure of Judas. As in Mr. Scorsese’s 1988 film, “The Last Temptation of Christ,” his messy, excitingly alive adaptation of that Nikos Kazantzakis novel, Judas must play a part in “Silence” because without him there can be no Jesus.
Once in Japan, Rodrigues and Garupe make contact with a village of hidden Christians, who live in fear of the authorities and a cobralike smiler known as the Inquisitor, Inoue (Issey Ogata, in one of the film’s strongest performances). By day, the priests hide in a small, cramped hut near the village; by night, they lead their new flock in dimly lighted rooms, delivering sermons in Latin, baptizing children and taking confession. Mr. Scorsese draws some modest, uneasy comedy from the linguistic and cultural differences between the priests and their congregation, as when a grabby, highly agitated woman begs the rather startled Garupe to hear her confession.
Despite the mugging from both confessor and confessed, the exchange feels forced and comes across as a bid to lighten the gloom; if anything, it turns a feverish plea for absolution into a bit of vaudeville. There’s something uncomfortably and literally childlike about this child of God, who, like the other villagers, with their pleading eyes and hands, seems like a relic from a white-savior myth. Kichijiro, who enters grunting and twitching, as if in homage to Toshiro Mifune, and grovels at the priest’s feet, also seems on hand as much for comic relief as for guidance. Yet, even as the film seems to share the outsider perspectives of Rodrigues and Garupe, instructively, it is the village elders — brilliantly played by Yoshi Oida and Shinya Tsukamoto — who give these scenes flesh, bone and pain.
“Silence” is based on the 1966 novel by the Japanese author Shusaku Endo that has attracted heavyweight admirers since it was first published. Graham Greene praised the novel, as did John Updike; for years, Mr. Scorsese tried to turn it into a film. (He wrote the foreword for a recent edition.) Filled with reams of religious dialogue, the novel fictionalizes history — the 17th-century purging of Christianity in Japan — as a means to explore religious faith and cultural difference. What preoccupies Endo is whether Western Christianity can take root in what the Inquisitor describes as “this swamp of Japan,” which seems inhospitable to outside forces. It’s a story of God, nation and myth.
It’s easy to understand Mr. Scorsese’s interest in the novel and specifically in the character of Rodrigues. Despite the priest’s piety, black vestments and narrative prominence, he is no more a Hollywood hero than most of Mr. Scorsese’s falling and fallen men, with their arrogance and vanity. Rodrigues cowers in fear, recoils from his flock and assures himself of the goodness that the church — and he, by extension — has brought. (He pities the worshipers but is proud of his ministering.) His faith, including in himself, sustains Rodrigues, but even as he tends to the souls of the hidden Christians he fails to ease their earthly suffering. God is silent; in a way, so is this most ardent missionary.
The silence of the title resounds insistently; it’s in the screams of the faithful and in Rodrigues’s endless searching. Why, he agonizes with no self-awareness, does God not answer prayers and alleviate suffering, a question which proves too heavy a load for Mr. Garfield’s talents. When he plays against the other actors, he can seem as decorative as a plaster saint (his luxuriously styled hair is right out of a 1950s biblical epic), which makes the other performers and their characters look stronger, and works for the story. Rodrigues is weak. But it’s weakness without depth or the burning belief that would make his errors shattering. When he carries on alone, speaking to God, questioning and suffering at great, monotonous length, his weakness becomes tedious, as does the film.
“Silence” argues against orthodoxy, but its messenger is too pallid. This is less the fault of Mr. Garfield than of Mr. Scorsese’s conception of Rodrigues as the story’s fulcrum instead of its void. Mr. Scorsese fills the film with haunting tableaus and performances — including from Tadanobu Asano, as the Interpreter — that tug from the edges, pulling attention away from its center. In the end, nothing that Rodrigues says resonates as deeply as Inoue’s terrifying, teasing whine, which conveys the larger cultural and political stakes; nothing imparts the mystery of creation as potently as the flicker of a darting emerald lizard or an eerie parade of cats prowling through a spookily deserted village.
These moments shake “Silence” and you too; the movie could use more jolts, more trembling, more surrealism; maybe, as in “The Last Temptation of Christ,” a talking lion to go along with its trippy lizard. “Silence” is as visually striking as you might expect, but also overly tidy, clean and decorous, despite its tortured flesh, its mud and its blood. There’s a crushing lack of urgency to this story and its telling, perhaps because it took Mr. Scorsese, who wrote the script with Jay Cocks, so long to make “Silence.” It’s disappointing because few directors can engage doubt and belief as powerfully as Mr. Scorsese can, but also because doubt and belief have again set the world on fire." 0.691394311 "Drama" "R" "Universal" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" NA

Mr. Foxx plays Vincent Downs, a Las Vegas homicide detective whose teenage son (Octavius J. Johnson) is snatched by drug dealers. Or, more precisely, by guys who work for the guy (Dermot Mulroney) who works for the main drug dealer (Scoot McNairy). Vincent and his partner, Sean (T.I.), have stolen 25 kilos of cocaine for reasons as murky as the movie’s nighttime cinematography. Vincent tries to return it, but his plans are complicated by the doggedness of an internal affairs officer named Jennifer Bryant (Michelle Monaghan). She has a partner (David Harbour, a walking spoiler alert). Vincent has an ex-wife (Gabrielle Union, deserving better in every way).
At the beginning, Jennifer and Vincent are shown with matching cuts on their cheekbones. By the end, they will both be much bloodier. Vincent, stabbed in the gut when his son is taken, will be battered with hotel-kitchen utensils and other weapons during a long and hectic night at a dimly-lighted casino.

Those are the high points of the movie, quick and nasty riffs to remind you of “Trainwreck” and raise your hopes for something similar. Those hopes are both fulfilled and disappointed.
Like most popular big-screen comic performers, Ms. Schumer is committed to consistency, or at least to exploiting a successful and familiar persona. She has become more or less what Will Ferrell was a decade and a half ago: the likable embodiment of various forms of human unpleasantness, a soft-bodied clown whose immunity to shame represents an appealing kind of innocence. Emily is self-absorbed, lazy and rude, but also so lacking in true meanness or guile and so dogged in her pursuit of shallow pleasures that she’s kind of fun to be around. Even though she drinks too much, says obnoxious things and misbehaves in other ways — killing two people, for example, one with a shovel and the other with a harpoon — it’s impossible to get mad at her, or even seriously annoyed.
That’s her mother’s job. “Snatched” is an intergenerational buddies-on-the-run movie, a strangely popular subgenre nowadays. Emily’s mom, Linda, is played by Goldie Hawn, who has been funny for a good half-century (going back to “Laugh-In”) and who is cruelly and inexplicably denied that privilege here. Linda, long-divorced and devoted to her two children (Emily’s toxic-nerd brother is played by Ike Barinholtz), functions as an uptight, anxious foil to her wildly undisciplined daughter. In principle that may be a slightly stale premise. In practice it’s just dull, and it’s frustrating to see Ms. Hawn robbed of the opportunity to be silly.
Supplemental silliness is supplied, instead, by Mr. Barinholtz, by Wanda Sykes and Joan Cusack (as a pair of intense tourists), by Christopher Meloni (as an Amazonian adventurer) and by Bashir Salahuddin (as a State Department bureaucrat). The story is nowhere near as hilarious as the director, Jonathan Levine, and the screenwriter, Katie Dippold, would like us to believe. (And not up to the standard of “The Heat” or “Ghostbusters,” both of which Ms. Dippold was also involved in.)
Emily drags Linda on a trip to Ecuador that turns calamitous when the two women are kidnapped by a gang of South American baddies. By “calamitous” I mean lazy, sloppy and witless. “Snatched” is one of those movies that subscribes to a dubious homeopathic theory of cultural insensitivity by which the acknowledgment of offensiveness is supposed to prevent anyone from taking offense. The idea is that if you use variations on the phrase “That’s racist!” as a punch line a few times, nothing else you say or do could possibly be racist. Including, say, populating your movie with dark-skinned thugs with funny accents and killing a few of them for cheap laughs.
Ms. Schumer has been criticized for this kind of thing before, and I suppose there’s a certain integrity in blithely refusing to care. It’s also true that comedy can be forgiven for a lot as long as it manages to make you laugh. Which “Snatched” did, in my case, a handful of times, including when Emily has a tapeworm and when her brother reaches out to the State Department for help rescuing his mother and sister. But though this movie ostensibly celebrates the spirit of adventure and openness to experience, it takes no risks and blazes no trails. It’s ultimately as complacent, self-absorbed and clueless as its heroine, and not always in an especially amusing way." 0.001507592 "Action" "R" "Fox" "$42,000,000 " "$19,542,248 " "$45,852,178 " "" "1,508" "18-Mar-83" "" "" NA

Mr. Heaney was recognized as a master of sean nos (old style) music, a traditional Gaelic variety of a cappella.
He was also an enigmatic figure, according to the film’s director Pat Collins, and “Song of Granite” seems to mirror what the character says about singing. As long as it does right by the music — of which there is plenty — everything else can be a fog.
Shot in black-and-white, the movie tries to shake off the biopic doldrums, employing a fragmented structure that emphasizes isolated moments instead of a narrative arc. It also includes snippets of the actual Mr. Heaney talking or in performance. But Mr. Collins doesn’t shed light on what makes his subject tick, and the arty shards never cohere.
Mr. Collins has cast real singers. Mr. Heaney is played as a boy by the poised Colm Seoighe, then as a haunted, noirish figure by Mr. O Chonfhaola. The character actor Macdara O Fatharta plays him as an older man. The first movement, observing the young Mr. Heaney as he absorbs Irish folk culture in County Galway, is the best and most accessible, before Mr. Heaney goes into moody exile in Britain and New York.
Offering scant commentary on the music, “Song of Granite” will appeal more to enthusiasts than to newcomers." 0.949969392 "Biography" "Not Yet Rated" "Oscilloscope Pictures" "" "$13,000 " "" "$4,194,583 " "847" "11-Apr-03" "10-Jul-03" "" NA

Mr. Malick, one of cinema’s philosopher kings, embraces fluidity as a visual principle and his films are filled with life’s ebb and flow — its swirling waters, swooping birds, stirring trees, billowing curtains, and gliding people and cameras. He loves silence and stillness, and the image of sunlight caressing a woman’s motionless face. But he is a searcher, and that searching informs his visual style with its restless, moving pictures.
There’s much to take in here, including the film’s narrative fragmentation, which requires you to go with the flow as you also puzzle together the story’s parts, themes and circling characters: Faye (Rooney Mara), a musician trying to find her way in Austin, Tex.; Cook (Michael Fassbender), a music producer and Faye’s sometime lover; and BV (Ryan Gosling), a musician and Faye’s other lover. A few other lovelies float in as well, including Rhonda (a moving Natalie Portman), a waitress who marries Cook; Amanda (Cate Blanchett), who has an affair with BV; and Zoey (Bérénice Marlohe), who has an affair with Faye. Holly Hunter, Iggy Pop, Johnny Rotten and Val Kilmer also drop in.
Mr. Malick began embracing narrative fragmentation years ago and it has increasingly characterized his films. Most movies rely on formulas, employing three or four acts, story beats and character arcs that are so standard you almost intuitively know when something will happen if not what. There will be a crisis; there will be a tidying up. “Song to Song” has distinct sections, but Mr. Malick frames them his own way. They move the narrative forward, but inside these sections time can seem to stutter, like a song on repeat. Many scenes are so short that they don’t seem to be overtly driving the story forward, but instead pile up and nearly swirl, like leaves caught in a gust.
The first section traces the earlier, joyful moments shared by Faye, Cook and BV; by the final section, Faye is stepping once more into a natural pool of water, challenging Heraclitus’s observation that you cannot step into the same river twice (life changes). Throughout, Mr. Malick inserts shots and short scenes that seem more like shards of memory, like those flashes from the past that suddenly materialize in the temporal slipstream. Faye and Cook gaze at each other warily; Faye and BV embrace; Faye and Cook embrace; at one point, all three fly off in a private plane to Mexico, where they cavort on a beach, wander around and get drunk amid a relay of looks.
During this idyll, play turns into a rehearsal for a possible future that’s telegraphed by a baby whom BV holds in one scene and by a tiny, elderly woman trembling alone in another scene. Cook also speaks in muted voice-over about Faye and BV as if telling himself a story. “They have a beauty in their life,” he murmurs, “that makes me ugly.” You have to take his word for it, because there’s very little here that’s intentionally ugly in “Song to Song.” Ugliness hovers like a threat, but is often only inadvertently conveyed, as when the film reduces Mexicans to touristic props. Cook, by contrast, just seems like a rich, bored henhouse fox who throws parties where women wait to be chosen and where one lies on a table like a centerpiece, food covering her naked body.
Cook’s world is a stage show or so he tells BV, a sentiment that Mr. Malick seems to share. It’s a beautiful, seductive show, an endless carnival (with little actual work or sweat) filled with jostling, occasionally colliding bodies that — whether playing onstage, thrashing in a mosh pit or seductively grinding on the floor — seem to be reaching, reaching, always reaching for something beyond these earthly, fleeting, sensual delights. As in Mr. Malick’s 2016 film “Knight of Cups” (about a screenwriter), sex and especially sex without love inevitably proves to be a crucial false promise, a temptation that leads to suffering, cascading tears and sometimes catastrophic, even fatal falls.
“Song to Song” continually flits — like the butterfly seen in one fleeting shot — from theme to theme, from love (always love) to fidelity, betrayal, identity, art, freedom, captivity, forgiveness and mercy. God is there, too, in nature and in the glowing, streaming sunlight, but also in a Madonna painted on the side of a building and in a Leonardo drawing of the Virgin Mary. The Leonardo shows up in a scene with Patti Smith, who plays herself (St. Patti) and compares Mary’s face to Faye’s. Ms. Smith tears a hole in the film because she’s so thrillingly present, so alive; playing against Ms. Smith, Ms. Mara seems lost and she just disappears, poof, like a snuffed-out candle.
Despite Ms. Smith’s electric sincerity this exchange finally feels false because Ms. Mara can’t convey the interiority that it requires, the kind of astonishing inner truth — call it a fever or call it grace, passion or holiness — effortlessly expressed by Ms. Smith and manifest in Leonardo’s Madonna. Mr. Malick’s filmmaking, with its storytelling ellipses and visual fragments, places a heavy burden on his performers, who need to build their characters primarily through individual voice-overs and in onscreen silence or near-silence, in gestures and movement. Mr. Fassbender does this brilliantly; too often, Ms. Mara and Mr. Gosling seem to be running through different acting exercises.
“Song to Song” is filled with beautiful people adrift in beautiful (glass) houses and natural settings. All this loveliness has its pleasures, but Mr. Malick’s visual choices also give the film a commercial luster that can rob that beauty of its power. That’s partly because the advertising world and mainstream cinema have long pilfered his aesthetic, turning it into a sales pitch. Mr. Malick is enraptured with beauty as an expression of God and as a path to God. But in “Song to Song” both the familiarity of his aesthetic and the inability of some of his actors to summon an inner light create immaculately photographed surfaces rather than immanence. You see the poses, not the divine.
That’s disappointing, even if there’s also much here that’s exhilarating, including the film’s ambitions and its seriousness. Seriousness in cinema is often viewed with suspicion and that’s as true now as it was when, say, Antonioni shook up the art. The difference is that now seriousness (and beauty and grace) is rarely part of a wider discussion, because that conversation is dominated by corporate cinema, where there’s often little to argue over and get excited by. There is, by contrast, much to admire in “Song to Song” and much to argue with, including its ideas about pleasure and women. So go, fall into its embrace, resist its charms, argue.

Loose and unforced, this debut feature from Amber Fares explores the rewards and challenges of belonging to the first female streetcar racing team in the Middle East.
Situated in the West Bank — and with the Israeli occupation a constantly nagging background presence — the story bounces among five young women as they navigate a sport whose judges might not be entirely neutral and whose rules can seem arbitrarily enforced. Racetracks are improvised in parking lots and empty market squares, and training spaces are elusive. The rush of racing, though, offers release and distraction from other frustrations in the women’s lives — though with five subjects to cover in only 80 minutes, Ms. Fares is by necessity less than probing.
As a result, most emerge with little more than a single defining trait — the modest one; the headstrong one; the outsider — that’s nevertheless enough to keep us engaged. The movie’s rough-and-tumble look works in its favor, and the occasional doldrums allow for reflection on the obstacles, military and otherwise, the women face daily. The absence of overt political statements, however, makes it all the more shocking when one woman is fired on by a border guard. Maybe trying to train near an Israeli detention center wasn’t such a good idea.
Subtly rebellious and defiantly optimistic, “Speed Sisters” masks the sound of gunshots with the roar of revving engines.

For decades, the residents of the tiny Tuscan town of Monticchiello have turned their lives into theater. Each year, they gather to discuss art and their world until they land on a topic that reflects their most recent, urgent concerns. Word by word, they push and pull, challenging one another as they shape a production. All the world’s a stage, but in Monticchiello that truism is movingly real, especially because these days its aging resident-players have more exits than entrances.
Perched on a hilltop some two hours south of Florence, Monticchiello tends to be one of those towns that in English-language guidebooks rates a line or two in between chapters on Florence and Venice. One such book mentions the town’s “Teatro Povero (a folk theater production)”; another notes its “forbidding walls” and “medieval past,” assuring readers that it’s “well worth exploring” even if over all “there is nothing much in the way of sights.” These mercenary assessments are meant, of course, for harried, hurried travelers, including those of us lucky enough to shape a few precious days into something we call vacation.
In their documentary “Spettacolo,” Jeff Malmberg and Chris Shellen stay a while. Their most obvious subject is the annual production that Monticchiello townspeople have mounted since the 1960s, when some could remember the Fascist occupation firsthand. In the early years, the residents put on pageants that, at least from the modest documentation in the movie, seem like elaborations on other regional events, like the centuries-old horse race called the Palio in nearby Siena. At some point, the Monticchiello residents turned to the more immediate past, revisiting, for instance, the trauma of the war and the day Nazis lined the villagers up, threatening to shoot them all.
More recently, the economy has fueled the spettacolo, which the movie’s notes define as “performance, spectacle or play.” That was certainly the case in 2012, when the bulk of the movie was shot over a period of six months. In interviews, Mr. Malmberg has said that he and Ms. Shellen happened on Monticchiello while on a vacation. (Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen, who are married, share directing credit; he shot and edited the documentary, and she recorded sound.) They were ambling around, rather like the day trippers in the documentary, when they accidentally came across Andrea Cresti, an artist who turned out to be theater’s longtime director as well as the portal into this story.
There’s very little about the making of the documentary itself in “Spettacolo,” which assumes the point of view of the unobtrusive, not-quite omniscient witness. The people tell their stories directly on camera, at times with deep emotion, their reminiscences augmented by faded photographs and archival moving images. The history of the theater emerges gradually as assorted personalities — former partisans, an ailing woman, an indifferent son — click into place. Perhaps inevitably, Mr. Cresti, a charismatic figure with a gray beard and a leonine halo of hair, becomes the focal point as he struggles to turn the town’s latest collective concerns into its next big show.
As the spettacolo takes shape with fractious dialogue and insistent politics, it becomes evident that the filmmakers are less interested in the final play than in its production, in its process and multiple meanings. Nothing if not discreet (and sly), Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen have shaped much of their material into four chapters that are named for the seasons. Each chapter is accompanied by ah-and-ooh beauty shots of the region, yet as winter gives way to spring and brown hills turn green, the day-to-day lives of the townspeople create a gentle, insistent critique of these seasonal postcards. Much like the town’s annual production, the movie is telling its own story dialectically.
That story can be so poignant and is so intelligently told that it feels wrong, almost insulting, to call “Spettacolo” charming, even if the movie is often delightful. In guidebooks, charm tends to be a commercial marker, a signifier for an imaginary, easily salable and consumable notion of authenticity. Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen understand the allure of that imaginary world; they were, after all, on vacation when they discovered Monticchiello and their documentary is itself often lovely. Yet they remind you that people are not attractions and their homes are not museums, even if the global economy, its casual tourists and rich speculators are determined to prove otherwise." 0.994607738 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Grasshopper Film" "" "" "$15,706 " "$7,709,977 " "1" "30-Mar-07" "5-Apr-07" "7" 1
"229" "Spider-Man: Homecoming" "7/7/2017" "6/29/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/movies/spider-man-homecoming-review.html" 0 "Sony’s latest Spider-Man movie is kind of like the first and fourth, even if it’s hard to keep track of what happened when in this on-and-off again series. Once more, it spins on Peter Parker (the nice, boyish Tom Holland), a teenager who develops super-skills after he’s bitten by a troublesome spider. The title of the likable, amusing “Spider-Man: Homecoming” indicates that this is a return, though to what exactly? To Queens? To youth? The rest of us can’t go home again, but given that this is the second Spider-Man reboot in 15 years from Sony Pictures it seems Spidey has few other options.
“Homecoming” is more or less about how Peter Parker needs to stay forever young, ideally 15 or so years old. What’s always been most appealing about Spider-Man is that he’s a kid, if one who can spin big, sticky webs and swing from rooftop to rooftop, comparatively rinky-dink talents in the flying, magic-hammering superhero world. What makes Spider-Man different and, ideally, work as a character, giving him an off-kilter charm, is he retains the uncertainties and vulnerabilities of adolescence. For all his super-gifts and despite the weird and dangerous company he keeps, he is also a teenage boy — that’s his Kryptonite, what cuts him down to recognizable human size.
The team behind “Homecoming” certainly gets that Spider-Man is a kid, even if the movie plays the naïf angle too hard at times, making Peter look not just inexperienced but also silly, a borderline dumb cluck. The movie — credited to six writers and directed by Jon Watts — opens sometime after Peter has been bitten. He’s still trying to get his bearings and struggling to figure out the limits of his powers, which is complicated here by the fact that this is the first Spider-Man movie that Sony has made with Marvel Studios. It’s a liaison that has brought Spider-Man into the Marvel worldwide domination machine, which is why he’s being mentored in the way of the superhero by Marvel’s Iron Man, a.k.a. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., who pops in and out).
That machine, known to executives and true believers as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is vast, complicated, lucrative and ever-expanding. It’s also intrinsically uninteresting for viewers (at least one!) who just want a good movie. Marvel has produced a string of movies of wildly divergent quality, but Sony has had a tougher time coming up with regular superhero successes. And so, after stumbling with its first “Spider-Man” resurrection, it cut a deal with Marvel, which is also not inherently interesting. Even so it’s modestly amusing to consider that Sony, much like Peter Parker here, needed help getting off the ground again, and so Marvel stepped in to play its Tony Stark-like guide.
For its initial hour, “Homecoming” moves along breezily enough, though sometimes with too much forced airiness. It works best when it sticks close to Peter and is content to be a light, good-natured story of a teenager who’s navigating through, and often badly fumbling, the competing demands of school, home and his emergent Spidey self. Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teenager than the actors who’ve previously suited up for this series, and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter’s best friend. Other good company includes Donald Glover, as a wrong-time, wrong-place criminal, and Martin Starr, who plays his teacher role with perfect deadpan timing.
Mr. Watts’s previous features include “Cop Car,” a slick, small-scaled nail-biter about two boys in peril that showed he knows where to put the camera, is good with actors and has a sadistic streak, which together presumably clinched his big-studio future. “Cop Car” is such an exercise in pressure-cooker cinema that it’s surprising how tamped down the sense of danger is in “Homecoming,” even in some of the earlier sequences in which Peter is still puzzling out how to scuttle and swing as he vanquishes villainy. A brief scene of him sneaking into his bedroom (to avoid Marisa Tomei’s Aunt May) has more tension than any single action set piece.
It’s tough to know who the biggest creative force is in a corporate entity like “Homecoming” and how much Mr. Watts contributed to its look, vibe and feel. The movie isn’t visually distinctive over all, and while some of the better action scenes stick low to the ground, as when Spider-Man crashes through suburban backyards and plays bumper cars with trash cans, the airborne special-effects scenes are disappointingly lackluster, particularly in the age of ambitious, eye-stroking diversions like “Doctor Strange.” It’s hard to think of a single image in “Homecoming” that will transcend a first viewing the way that Peter and M. J.’s tender, topsy-turvy kiss did in Sam Raimi’s first “Spider-Man.”
And then there’s Michael Keaton, who’s so very good in “Homecoming” that he suggests a future narrative path down which the older, more experienced Spider-Man might eventually go if ever allowed to truly grow up. Mr. Keaton plays the Vulture, the regulation baddie, who after weaponizing some extraterrestrial leftovers has become a criminal mastermind, with the usual yelling, minions and death. He flies around in a clunky winged apparatus that looks like something from the Wright Brothers’ steampunk phase. This makes for an amusing chunk of heavy-metal décor, but is mostly resonant as a tepid joke about Mr. Keaton’s aerial acrobatics in “Batman” and “Birdman.”
The Vulture is a mess of prickly contradictions, only some of which seem intentional. His criminality, rage and perhaps his madness have been stoked by class resentment and Mr. Keaton, with his white-hot menace and narrowing eyes, makes him a memorably angry man, not a caricature. The Vulture becomes a narrative counterweight to Tony Stark’s self-satisfied billionaire. But the Vulture is also the biggest enemy facing Spider-Man, who — as this movie reminds you — is a working-class kid turned superhero. Here, Spidey is eager to do a billionaire’s bidding, partly because he’s being readied to join the Avengers. The question is when Spidey really grows up, who will he fight for and why?" 0.20219816 "Action" "PG-13" "Sony / Columbia" "$175,000,000 " "$117,027,503 " "$334,201,140 " "" "1,954" "7-Aug-92" "" "" NA
"230" "Split" "1/20/2017" "1/19/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/movies/split-review-m-night-shyamalan.html" 0 "At once solemn and preposterous, sinister and sentimental, efficient and overwrought, “Split” represents something of a return to form for its writer and director, M. Night Shyamalan. Or maybe I should say a return to formula. The movie, shot in and around Philadelphia, Mr. Shyamalan’s hometown, proceeds nimbly and with suave misdirection toward a pair of rug-pulling final twists that an attentive viewer will probably be able to anticipate. It’s not exactly a Choose Your Own Adventure, but you can opt either for the pleasure of surprise at the end or for the satisfaction of working out the puzzle as you go along.
Thanks to “The Sixth Sense” and “Unbreakable” back around the turn of the century, Mr. Shyamalan stands as a pioneer of spoiler-centric cinema. Like those movies, and like his later, lesser entertainments (“The Village”; “The Happening”), “Split” is all plot, an ingenious (and also ridiculous) conceit spun into an elegant ribbon of suspense. The less said about that plot, therefore, the better.
What I can safely divulge is that three teenage girls are kidnapped after a birthday party by a close-cropped guy named Dennis in a buttoned-up shirt. He is obsessed with cleanliness, and he sounds weirdly like John Turturro for a guy supposedly from Philly. In fact, Dennis is played by the soft-eyed, shape-shifting British actor James McAvoy, as are the other 23 personalities residing in the body of a guy who shares the surname of a famous (and famously odd) Philadelphia-born artist.
These “alters” — a word familiar to fans of the Showtime series “United States of Tara” and other pop-cultural treatments of a controversial and often poorly understood psychological disorder — are a diverse bunch. Some are male, some female, at least one is a child (named Hedwig) and another (named Barry) is a gay stereotype. What they want with their captives is not immediately clear. What Mr. Shyamalan wants is to strip them down to their underwear and to explore, exploit and occasionally subvert the basic tropes of the female-victim psycho-slasher movie.
One of the young women — a gothy, spooky misfit named Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) — is singled out for special attention from the camera (though not, at least initially, from Dennis and his colleagues). Her fellow abductees, Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula), alternate between panic and defiance, but Casey counsels patience and watchfulness. Flashbacks to a hunting trip she took as a 5-year-old (Izzie Leigh Coffey) in the company of her father (Sebastian Arcelus) and uncle (Brad William Henke) seem to explain the source of her survival skills, though it turns out that those memories have another, darker meaning as well.
Dennis and company, meanwhile — it’s mostly Barry, actually — consult with a therapist, Dr. Fletcher, who lives alone in a gracious, book-stuffed rowhouse and who is played by the wonderful Betty Buckley. Dr. Fletcher’s primary function is to explain the movie to the audience, foreshadowing the climax with her heterodox pseudo-scholarly theories about her many-sided patient, but Ms. Buckley also provides a dimension of warmth and wit that “Split” would be much duller and uglier without.
Mr. McAvoy, for his part, revels in the chance to use his sensitivity for evil, and to showboat his way through a series of appropriately overwrought characterizations. This breathlessly melodramatic thriller shouldn’t be taken as a psychological case study, any more than Mr. Shyamalan’s laughable “Lady in the Water” should be mined for clues about the habits of film critics.
“Split” is lurid and ludicrous, and sometimes more than a little icky in its prurient, maudlin interest in the abuse of children. It’s also absorbing and sometimes slyly funny. Some years back — it’s startling to contemplate just how long ago it was — Mr. Shyamalan was puffed up into a cinematic visionary, hailed on the cover of Newsweek as “The Next Spielberg.” That hype (and his own self-aggrandizing tendencies) placed a disproportionate burden of significance on a filmmaker who has always been, at heart, a superior genre hack.
“Split” is being released by Universal under the Blumhouse label, a brand associated with unpretentious, clever, neo-traditionalist scare-pictures like “Insidious,” “Paranormal Activity” and “The Purge.” That seems like the right company for Mr. Shyamalan, and the January pre-Oscar doldrums may be the perfect moment to appreciate his skills. He is a master of mood, pace and limited perspective, moving the camera so that the thing you most desperately want to see — and are most afraid of seeing — remains teasingly out of sight.
He uses Ms. Taylor-Joy’s enormous dark eyes as a mirror and a lure for the audience’s attention. He delays the inevitable, inevitably deflationary revelations for as long as possible, minimizing the obligatory third-act flurry of chasing, fighting and bloodletting. And he sneaks in a few self-referential winks, including an allusion to his last really good movie that feels at once like a promise of better mischief to come and an implicit apology for all the disappointment in between." 0.112037656 "Horror" "PG-13" "Universal" "$9,000,000 " "$40,010,975 " "$138,291,365 " "" "1,384" "17-Feb-84" "" "" NA
"231" "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" "12/15/2017" "12/12/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-review.html" 1 "Evil is ascendant. The Resistance — an intrepid, multi-everything group whose leaders include a battle-tested woman warrior — has been fighting the good fight for years but is outnumbered and occasionally outmaneuvered. Yes, the latest “Star Wars” installment is here, and, lo, it is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever).
“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” picks up where the story left off two years ago in “The Force Awakens,” the leadoff of the series’ newest trilogy. Keeping track of where each “Star Wars” title fits into the overall scheme of things can be brain-numbing (the movies weren’t made in story-chronological order), but the strongest ones work as stand-alones and let you just go with the onscreen flow. The writer-director of “The Last Jedi,” Rian Johnson, frontloads the critical back story intel — who’s fighting who and the like — in the opening crawl. And then he gets down to the difficult business of putting his fingerprints on a franchise that deliberately resists individual authorship.
Mr. Johnson largely succeeds despite having inherited an elaborate ecosystem with a Manichaean worldview divided between heroes (a.k.a. the Resistance) and villains (the First Order). That’s about all you need to know to follow this movie, which charts the franchise’s future while continuing to pass the baton from its first holy trinity — Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill — to a new trio, introduced in “The Force Awakens.” Mr. Ford’s character, Han Solo, exited the series in that movie. As Leia, Ms. Fisher plays a critical role in this new one, but her death last December (after production ended) imparts real melancholy to a series that from its start has been defined — if not always comfortably — by loss.
And so, once upon a time yet again, peace remains elusive and weapons are locked, loaded and often firing. Here, the fight continues with Leia searching for her absent brother, Luke Skywalker (Mr. Hamill), while leading the Resistance against the First Order, the dark-side successor to the dictatorial Empire (Darth Vader’s cohort). The old Imperial evildoers have been replaced by the suitably cartoonish-sounding Snoke (created by the hard-working Andy Serkis and digital effects), a wormy, towering ghoul with vivid scars and an insinuating sneer. He commands the usual stormtroopers along with the impetuous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a charismatic villain who has closely fashioned himself after Vader.
The story is a tangle, but its complications are mitigated by Mr. Johnson’s quick pace and the appealing performers. Like most contemporary action flicks, this one more or less plays out as a succession of fights, chases and time outs (for chatting, scheming or lonely musing) across two or more plot lines. Having joined together in “The Force Awakens,” the story’s latest dream team — Rey (Daisy Ridley), a scavenger turned warrior; Finn (John Boyega), a First Order deserter turned resister; and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), a Resistance fighter pilot — now often spends time apart. Poe spins in Leia’s orbit while Rey pesters Luke, and Finn finds a winning ally (Kelly Marie Tran).
An early heroic death sets the sober mood and stakes while gently re-establishing the franchise’s new commitment to diversifying the overall picture. As in “The Force Awakens,” this inclusion feels natural, a vision of the future you can recognize. About the only time it feels as if Mr. Johnson is checking “Star Wars” boxes is in some of the fights, especially during an impasse that turns into a slow-moving game of space chess. He may be checking off some of those boxes in an ode to George Lucas; whatever the case, Mr. Johnson only infrequently comes across as dutiful or as overtly brand-expanding (as with a troika of calculatingly cute tykes who unnervingly suggest this series really will go on forever).
One of the truisms of the “Star Wars” series is that its battle between good and bad has always uneasily and sometimes openly mirrored the attendant struggle between good and bad filmmaking. Mr. Lucas’s 1977 foundational movie mostly transcends its flaws with slick looks, hooky effects, old-school heroics and loads of marketable material that helped turn fan love into an ecumenical cult. The second trilogy, entirely directed by Mr. Lucas, began in 1999 with “The Phantom Menace” (infamous for the minor scandal called Jar Jar Binks) and is pretty much a drag outside of some fleet light-saber duels and the arresting black-and-red patterning that distinguishes one villain.
Part of what has already made the new trilogy more successful is that its directors, J.J. Abrams (“The Force Awakens”) and Mr. Johnson, are technically adept, commercially savvy “Star Wars” true believers who came of age in the post-Lucas blockbuster era. Each has had to navigate the intricacies of Mr. Lucas’s sprawling fiction while handling the deep imprint created by Darth Vader’s heavy-breathing menace, R2-D2’s amusing beeps, Mr. Ford’s insouciance, Mr. Hamill’s earnestness, and Ms. Fisher’s smarts and latter-day screwball charm. Unlike Mr. Lucas, though, Mr. Abrams and Mr. Johnson don’t feel burdened by that legacy; they’re into it, charged up, despite the pressures of such an industrial enterprise. They’re resolving their cinematic father issues with a sense of fun.
Mr. Johnson can make you forget about those issues as well as the franchise’s insistent obligations; it also seems like he had a good time at work. He brings lightness to his banter, visual flair (not simply bleeding-edge special effects) to the design, and narrative savvy to Rey and Kylo Ren’s relationship. Mr. Johnson’s use of deep red is characteristic of how he turns ideas into images, most vividly with a set that looks like something Vincente Minnelli might have dreamed up for a Flash Gordon musical with Gene Kelly. When that set becomes the backdrop to a viscerally exciting fight, all the red abruptly evokes the spilled blood that this otherwise squeaky clean series insistently elides.
Like “The Force Awakens,” “The Last Jedi” engages with the first “Star Wars” movie less as a fetish than as a necessary point of departure. And, like Alec Guinness’s Obi-Wan Kenobi once did, Luke comes off as a brooding monastic loner. With a hooded robe, beard and inexplicable moodiness, he has retreated to an eerily lovely, isolated island where imaginatively designed critters roam and trill. The cutest (right in time for Christmas tie-ins) are Porgs, saucer-eyed mewling creatures with plump, puffin-like bodies that are mainly on hand for easy laughs. The creature design throughout is so inventive — there are less-fuzzy whatsits on the island, too — that you wish more had been added.
You feel Mr. Johnson periodically reining himself in, yet the movie cuts loose when he does, as when he embraces the galaxy’s strangeness, its non-humanoid beings as well as its magic and mystery. There’s a trippy scene in which a character floats into a resurrection, an ethereal drift that borders on the surreal. It’s a fleeting bliss-out in a series that knows how to bring the weird but has too often neglected to do so amid its blaster zapping, machinations and Oedipal stressing and storming. This is, after all, a franchise in which the most indelible character remains Yoda, the wee, far-out philosophizer with the tufted pate and syntactically distinct truth telling: “Wars not make one great.”
Wars do, however, make warehouses of money as this franchise has been affirming for decades. It’s instructive how normalized its permanent war has become, with its high body count, bloodlessness and fascist chic (the black uniforms evoking the Nazi SS). Given this, it’s notable, too, that while Mr. Johnson manages the big-canvas battles well enough, he’s better with smaller-scaled fights, in which the sweat, vulnerabilities and personal costs of violence are foregrounded. With Mr. Driver — who delivers a startlingly raw performance — Mr. Johnson delivers a potent portrait of villainy that suggests evil isn’t hard-wired, an inheritance or even enigmatic. Here, it is a choice — an act of self-creation in the service of annihilation.
Mr. Johnson has picked up the baton — notably the myth of a female Jedi — that was handed to Mr. Abrams when he signed on to revive the series with “The Force Awakens.” Mr. Johnson doesn’t have to make the important introductions; for the most part, the principals were in place, as was an overarching mythology that during some arid periods has seemed more sustained by fan faith than anything else. Even so, he has to convince you that these searching, burgeoning heroes and villains fit together emotionally, not simply on a Lucasfilm whiteboard, and that they have the requisite lightness and heaviness, the ineffable spirit and grandeur to reinvigorate a pop-cultural juggernaut. That he’s made a good movie in doing so isn’t icing; it’s the whole cake." 0.998163807 "Action" "PG-13" "Buena Vista" "" "$220,009,584 " "" "" "1,904" "26-Aug-94" "" "" NA
"232" "Staying Vertical" "1/20/2017" "1/19/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/movies/staying-vertical-review.html" 0 "Alain Guiraudie’s “Staying Vertical,” a minor sensation at Cannes in May, starts like a thriller, proceeds like the setup to a dirty joke and ends like a folk tale. In the middle it’s more or less a comedy about a feckless guy taking care of a baby.
The mood, however, is hardly madcap. It’s more like sadcap. Mr. Guiraudie, whose earlier films include “Stranger by the Lake,” has an eye for rural French landscapes and an ear for deadpan conversation. His hero, a stalled screenwriter named Léo (Damien Bonnard), has a passive-aggressive habit of showing up and hanging around, as if he thinks that charming other people and annoying them amounted to the same thing.
The first person he encounters, on a drive through the countryside, is a young man named Yoan (Basile Meilleurat), whom he tries to pick up with lines that are tired in any language. (“Have you ever been in a movie?” “Would you like to audition?”) When those advances don’t work, Léo moves on to Marie (India Hair), a shepherdess — the farmer’s daughter in the dirty joke — with whom he has more success. It’s hard to say if he seduces her or the other way around, but after some explicit sex (inspired less by pornography than by Gustave Courbet’s painting “The Origin of the World”), they have a child. It’s her third, and his first.
“Staying Vertical” is the opposite of a romantic comedy, though, so Marie takes off with her other sons, leaving Léo to care for the infant. Marie’s father, Jean-Louis (Raphaël Thiéry), tries to help out, sort of. After arguing with Léo about the relative merits of sleep-training and co-sleeping — a debate that plenty of more conventional modern parents have had — Jean-Louis spirits the child away to a hillside to serve as wolf bait. The wolves that menace Marie’s flocks supply Mr. Guiraudie with a folkloric dimension, and a haunting climax.
Otherwise, Léo resumes his pursuit of Yoan, argues with Yoan’s grizzled, rock ’n’ roll-loving guardian (Christian Bouillette) and fails to write a script, promising his producer pages and begging for money in advance. He visits a woman (Laure Calamy) in the forest who is equal parts shaman and therapist.
Léo’s motives are at times as obscure as Mr. Guiraudie’s, and the film’s studied obliqueness is intriguing as well as puzzling. Its manner of punctuating tedium with shock at times feels strained — an attempt to exploit dwindling resources of cinematic provocation — but “Staying Vertical” still has a rough gravity that holds your attention and sticks in your mind.

A case of excellent actors’ straining to elevate a contrived screenplay, “Strange Weather,” directed by Katherine Dieckmann (the atmospheric “Diggers”), casts Holly Hunter as Darcy, an academic administrator, at a university in Georgia. Darcy is at a crossroads: Applying for a belated bachelor’s degree, she may soon lose her job to budget cuts. Her son, Walker, committed suicide seven years earlier.
Darcy soon learns that Mark (Shane Jacobsen), a friend of Walker’s, has grown wealthy after founding a chain of hot dog restaurants — Walker’s idea. Conspiring to confront Mark in New Orleans, she brings along her friend Byrd (Carrie Coon) and the gun Walker used to kill himself, probably more for symbolism than for proving Chekhov’s axiom.
The journey is a pretext for healing, as Darcy visits an old friend (Glenne Headly, who died in June) and Walker’s father (Ted Ferguson), who abused her but is now ailing and mute. This gives Darcy a chance to unburden her thoughts to him while allowing Ms. Dieckmann, who wrote the screenplay, to avoid the complications of constructing a conversation.

His “All the Real Girls” (2003) and “Snow Angels” (2007) brought acute, cleareyed, compassionate consideration to trauma and tragedy as they affect intimate relationships. Unlike those pictures, though, “Stronger” carries a separate weight. It’s also about an actual galvanic event in recent American history.
“Stronger” is the story of Jeff Bauman, a resident of Chelmsford, Mass., who lost both his legs above the knee in the terrorist bombings of the Boston Marathon in 2013.
The movie, based on Mr. Bauman’s autobiography, begins with a depiction of him as a relatively amiable screw-up. Played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who’s almost a decade older than Mr. Bauman was at the time of the events shown, the character is nevertheless a convincing man-child. After making a grisly mess of a chicken-roasting task at the Costco where he works, Jeff repairs to his local, where he drinks and curses and makes moon-eyes at his ex-girlfriend Erin (Tatiana Maslany), a rather more directed soul who’s popped in to collect donations for her marathon run. Seizing on a notion to win her back, Jeff hand-letters a sign to brandish near the race’s finish line. He sees one of the bombers moments before the explosion that costs him his legs.
For Mr. Bauman and his milieu, Mr. Green forgoes the standard Hollywood clichés about boisterous, hard-drinking, “politically incorrect” working-class Bostonians in favor of characters who are far, far, far more boisterous, hard-drinking and “politically incorrect.” It’s kind of terrifying. For instance, Jeff’s mother, Patty, in an astounding turn by Miranda Richardson, is a slovenly, resentful, egocentric drunk who frequently prioritizes her hangovers over Jeff’s physical rehabilitation appointments. For all that, the movie itself never judges its people.
“Stronger” takes more artistic risks than any other American-made “inspired by true events” picture I can recall. The emotions and situations depicted, as Jeff struggles with PTSD, his immobility, his relationship with Erin and his hometown-hero status (which he believes to be completely unearned), are raw, sometimes desperate. A scene late in the film in which Jeff begs not to be abandoned is played at such a high pitch that it flirts with, then transcends, bathos.
But as it approaches the two-hour mark, the movie seems to wake to the fact that it has to live up to its title. Then “Stronger” rushes through what screenwriting gurus call the “redemptive arc,” with little concern for just how its lead character makes the life changes that enable him to face his responsibilities. And in that respect, it brings the viewer up short." 0.924544723 "Biography" "R" "Roadside Attractions" "" "" "$4,211,129 " "" "4" "19-Nov-04" "28-Jul-05" "252" 36

This may not be news, even in the movie industry, which loves white-picket fences in principle but remains a gated community in fact. Still, every so often a filmmaker restates the case for the prosecution. The latest complainant is George Clooney, who in directing “Suburbicon” has turned back the clock to the 1950s for a story about the good old American days of prosperity and prejudice, of race hate and white people who are always just one clenched fist away from becoming a mob.
The title refers to the ticky-tacky Potemkin suburb where it all goes down. You know the place: It’s as American as apple pie and quiet desperation. It’s the post-World War II wasteland with the identical homes, lawns and faces that has been grist for critique and caricature, novels and movies, ever since suburbs were invented. In “Little Boxes,” a 1960s lament about conformity, Pete Seeger warbles about that sprawling wasteland, where all the “boys go into business and marry and raise a family.” That these little boxes look a lot like coffins gives his song the tenor of a dirge, one that “Suburbicon” delivers anew with cruel laughter, violent enthusiasm and acres of dark-wood paneling.
Matt Damon plays Gardner Lodge, some kind of executive who has his own office and secretary at work and a wife, Rose (Julianne Moore), and son, Nicky (a good, appealing Noah Jupe), at home. It all looks neat and tidy, especially Suburbicon, a planned community dotted with houses as square as Gardner’s sack suits and yards that look as if they’d been landscaped using a compass and protractor. There are a few midcentury modern flourishes, but the sheer, overriding, bland whiteness underscores that this entire world has been drawn along the antiseptic lines of a period sitcom like “Father Knows Best” rather than a riposte like “Mad Men.”
The story opens just as the Mayerses, Suburbicon’s first black family, move into the area, an event the neighborhood treats as a collective home invasion. Women whisper and stare, men sputter and rage, and soon all their white faces have gone red. Before long, unneighborly clusters begin gathering around the family’s home, edging around the perimeter and transforming it into a kind of stage. And then the fences go up, and the clusters develop into a pack. The whispers morph into jeers, and the progressively, dangerously impatient crowd howls for the show to begin. Any resemblance to the audience watching “Suburbicon” is as intentional as it is obvious.
Mr. Clooney, who wrote the movie with Grant Heslov — reworking a script by Ethan and Joel Coen — has embraced symmetry as his guiding principle. Everything looks picture perfect in Suburbicon, and the story is so ordered that at first the movie seems to be a tale of two families, twinned peoples whose only sons dress alike and play catch in yards that face each other as if mirrored images. That there aren’t any movie stars in the Mayers family, though, is an early sign that all isn’t quite as balanced as it seems. Karimah Westbrook has a few good moments as Mrs. Mayers, but Leith Burke, as Mr. Mayers, barely says a word. Tony Espinosa has more to do as the couple’s son, Andy.
Still, the families are further aligned when, shortly after the Mayerses move in, two thugs invade the Lodge home. Except instead of simply robbing the family, they kill someone, violence that shifts the story’s focus to the Lodges. It’s a lurching turn as well as a missed opportunity. The story of the Mayers family is grounded in the history that clearly appeals to Mr. Clooney — it’s based on events that took place in Levittown, Pa., in 1957 — but what happens to the Lodges plays like one of the Coens’ signature Looney Tunes as written by James M. Cain. By the time Oscar Isaac swoops in with a fedora and a wolfish grin, the movie has become a bludgeoning pastiche.
Mr. Clooney gets some things right in “Suburbicon,” including visually and with his two appealing child actors, who together give the movie a heartbeat. As the story grows grimmer and pulpier, he plays with different registers of realism, deepens the shadows and narrows his focus, using tight close-ups and all the wood paneling to box the characters in. But he skimps on the adult characters’ inner lives, and, once the narrative weight shifts to the Lodges, he never finds the tone that balances the movie’s sincerity with its nihilism. One problem is that Mr. Clooney seems to believe in happy endings, however hard-earned, while the Coens — whose presence hovers throughout — are the kind of pessimists who laugh in the dark. The tones and worldviews don’t jibe.
The greater, graver flaw, though, the one that empties “Suburbicon” out and turns it into a mannerist exercise, is that the movie reproduces the inequality it’s ostensibly outraged by. This has less to do with star power and everything to do with emphasis and interest. It’s clear even from her few scenes, including a showdown with a racist, that Ms. Westbrook could have made Mrs. Mayers a force if given the chance. Yet despite the parallel editing, despite the scenes of the mob plaguing the Mayerses — and the images of a black mother, father and son who are sometimes seen but say so little — their terror isn’t about them. It’s about how bad it makes white people look." 0.318876747 "Crime" "R" "Paramount" "" "$2,840,246 " "$5,775,178 " "" "91" "18-Aug-17" "5-Oct-17" "49" 7

Set in 1995, four years before the massacre at Columbine High School, “Super Dark Times” is the story of lifelong best friends Zach and Josh, who are each navigating the treacherous waters of high school social standing. What unsupervised time they have is spent crashing on each other’s couches, playing video games, and identifying crushes from their yearbooks, and if Zach seems a little more handsome, a little more sociable, a little less nerdy than his friend, it’s the kind of difference in temperament that might have gone unacknowledged forever. But when Zach and Josh find themselves involved in a horrific accident that claims the life of a friend, the underlying tensions between the boys are stretched thin by guilt, panic and paranoia.
The performances from the film’s young cast members are uniformly excellent, including Owen Campbell as Zach and Charlie Tahan as Josh. But the direction from Mr. Phillips is what makes “Super Dark Times” unusual. In the movie’s scenes of violence, in particular, what we hear complicates what we see, as the impact of blunt physical trauma mixes with the film’s score to suggest the psychic magnitude of accidental violence. While another movie might have leaned harder on ripped-from-the-headlines prurience, “Super Dark Times” instead aims to become a more elusive pleasure — a simple story, well told." 0.984275026 "Drama" "Not Yet Rated" "The Orchard" "" "$11,600 " "$11,600 " "$4,810 " "18" "30-Oct-09" "10-Dec-09" "42" 6

Some have sensory issues with touch and sound. That’s all the more reason to have the Jersey Hammerheads, the Special Olympics swimming team Mr. McQuay founded with his wife, Maria, inspired by Mikey, their son.
Mikey, one of the Hammerheads’ stars, is among the three principal subjects of “Swim Team,” a documentary by Lara Stolman. (An excerpt from the movie appeared on The New York Times’s website in 2015.) The others are Robbie, who says he aspires to be faster than Michael Phelps, and Kelvin, who has Tourette’s syndrome in addition to autism.
Made over the course of two years, the documentary follows the challenges they face, both personally and as a group. (We’ll avoid spoiling which one went on to compete nationally and which one became captain of his high school swim team.) The movie also trails their parents, who raise their children — mostly teenagers — without a rule book, at times feeling isolated themselves, but finding camaraderie in one another. Near the end, Mr. McQuay says he believes that having an autistic son made him a more attentive father.
Issue documentaries often struggle to come across as movies, not simply as informational tools. At its most effective, “Swim Team” treats its subjects as would any sports movie attuned to character and drama. There is real suspense when Robbie runs late for a meet, risking setting back his entire team.
Later, Maria and Michael believe that the Hammerheads have come in first at a meet and are upset to see them receive only participation medals. (They soon realize that they lost the gold because one of the team’s members — not among the three profiled — earned a disqualification for starting a race with the wrong stroke.)
Elsewhere, “Swim Team” deals more specifically with autism. Maria and Michael meet with a lawyer to determine whether they should seek guardianship of Mikey, who at 18 would otherwise be regarded as an adult by New Jersey. In an uncomfortably candid conversation, Robbie’s mother sits down to explain to him that he’s autistic, something he doesn’t already know. (“Do you see yourself different from the regular kids in school?” she asks.)
While watching “Swim Team,” it’s worth remembering that even the smallest documentary crews aren’t invisible. Kelvin’s mother tells us that he becomes nervous in public places when people stare at him. Sure enough, there are gawkers when they shop at a Goodwill store. In fairness to the onlookers, some may not be staring because of Kelvin’s tics, but because Kelvin is being filmed — hardly an everyday occurrence.

The table in question is parked on the periphery of a wedding reception and designated, per the seating plan, for “the randoms”: those guests one feels obliged to invite but who, one hopes, will decline.

Inexplicably pining for this charmless doofus, Eloise alternates between stalking him and trying to make him jealous, endeavors equally bereft of laughs and dignity.

Pat Healy plays a sad sack named Ray with a kidnap-fantasy business: He abducts people at their request for therapeutic or thrill-seeking purposes. Anna (Taylor Schilling of “Orange Is the New Black,” who is the best thing about this movie) requests his services, but she doesn’t want merely the usual eight-hour adventure. She wants an entire weekend, and she wants it rough.
Thus begins a blunder-filled odyssey that soon has Ray and, presumably, the viewer wondering who is manipulating whom and whether Ray has even snatched the right person. Parts of it work, but the overall package is never really suspenseful enough to have you on edge or overtly funny enough to be a lark.
Mr. Healy also directed, which might have been a mistake. Another set of eyes might have coaxed more complementary performances out of the two leads, who individually are amusing but seem as if they’re operating on different comedic planes.

Yet despite laws dictating that her indigenous performances remain private, Te Ata eventually acted and danced on Broadway and for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s White House. She became an advocate, through her own artistic excellence, for the inherent dignity that the federal government denied American Indians — fittingly, her stage name means “bearer of the morning.” Te Ata’s life story is now the subject of Nathan Frankowski’s film “Te Ata,” which goes for the sweep of an epic despite a tight budget.
As depicted, Te Ata, who died in 1995 at the age of 99, grew up as Mary Frances Thompson in the Indian Territory that later became Oklahoma. She devoted her life to relaying the Chickasaw legends she had learned in childhood, in addition to the stories that were shared with her by the diverse American Indian audiences she met on tour.
Produced by Chickasaw Nation Productions, “Te Ata” valorizes this little-known hero, introducing elements of myth like a wandering white wolf to mark Te Ata’s life as its own Chickasaw legend. The film sprawls from the Oklahoma plains to old New York, murkily conveying the passage of time and her rising social status. But the movie’s driving force is its mythic performance scenes, which are choreographed, sung and acted with clear, balletic conviction by the film’s star, Q’orianka Kilcher, who collaborated with Chickasaw researchers and advisers.

It’s “Of Men and War,” a 2015 documentary shot at the Pathway Home in Yountville, Calif., a center designed to reacclimate veterans to civilian life — and also where one of the characters in “Thank You for Your Service” winds up. “Of Men and War” demanded that viewers witness the psychic scars of fighting, measuring them as part of war’s cost along with the dead and more visibly wounded.
Mr. Hall, working in a more sentimental, multiplex-friendly mode, makes the same point here. The movie is partly adapted from the well-received 2013 book by The Washington Post’s David Finkel, who followed survivors of a battalion he had chronicled in an earlier book. Working freehandedly, Mr. Hall contrives motivations and friendships for dramatic effect. (One of the main three returning soldiers in the movie, played by Joe Cole, who arrives in Kansas only to learn that his fiancée has left him, has been added to the mix.)
The central protagonist is Adam Schumann (Miles Teller, convincingly tough), who still instinctively scans American roadsides for bombs just as he did in Iraq. He has missed crucial time with his wife (Haley Bennett, whose character and performance go beyond sympathetic-wife clichés) and young children. He is haunted by two incidents for which he feels responsible: his imperfect rescue of a comrade shot in the head, seen in a prologue, and another death, revealed only gradually, that left his wife’s friend Amanda Doster (Amy Schumer, in a successfully counterintuitive bit of casting) a widow.
The other principal character is Tausolo Aeiti (Beulah Koale, a newcomer), who suffers from crippling memory loss that hampers daily functioning. As with Adam, part of Tausolo’s trouble is admitting his problems to himself. The movie argues that the military stifles such breakthroughs on two fronts: first with a culture that encourages stoicism, second with a failure to provide prompt medical care for veterans.
Striving for the elusive goal of political neutrality, Mr. Hall has made a less jingoistic film than “American Sniper” (in the combat sequences, villainous Iraqis have been replaced with faceless ones). Instead, “Thank You for Your Service” is a macho weepie, whose message — that wars are permanent for those who fight in them — has broad appeal.
That Iraq seems unlikely to produce another “The Best Years of Our Lives” has as much to do with changes in Hollywood craft as with the divisiveness of the war. If, like its characters, “Thank You for Your Service” sometimes struggles to balance staying strong with wearing its heart on its sleeve, it makes an emotional plea in a direct, effective way." 0.944277086 "Biography" "Unrated" "Gathr Films" "$300,000 " "$5,199 " "$10,514 " "$13,287,735 " "322" "1-Aug-14" "16-Oct-14" "77" 11

By the time he’s out of prison four years (which is to say a few seconds) later, Sylvie and Dave have sobered up and conceived a child. This makes for an awkward Christmastime homecoming.
Kenny (Kevin Janssens), with a slick of dark hair down the middle of his head and a Kirk Douglas dimple in the center of his chin, is the wilder sibling, eager to fight and possessing a certain thuggish charm. Dave (Jeroen Perceval), bald and slight, is comparatively quiet and sensitive. Sylvie (Veerle Baetens), who works in a nightclub and goes to recovery meetings, seems tougher and more levelheaded than either brother, though you have to wonder a bit about her taste in men. And you might also wonder where the boys’ mother (Viviane de Muynck) went wrong.
In any case, “The Ardennes,” directed by Robin Pront, takes an effective (if not terribly original) pulp premise and executes it with a decent measure of soul and skill. The film’s title refers to the densely forested part of Belgium where the  Battle of the Bulge was fought in World War II, and the plot swerves from the unspecified Flemish city where Dave, Kenny and Sylvie live toward that savage sylvan landscape. The brothers (and the audience) find a few surprises there, a handful of colorful secondary characters and some arresting nonnative fauna.
The machinery of the plot is propelled by a grim sense of lower-depth fatalism. Sylvie, in her meetings and in conversations with Dave, talks about taking control and making choices, but Kenny’s return threatens to make a cruel joke of their optimism. The rules of this genre dictate that people can’t change, that those who try to pull themselves out are dragged back in, and that blood loyalty and bloodshed are never very far apart.
Mr. Pront doesn’t have much new to say on these themes, but he does have a strong sense of place and a brisk, gritty directing style.

But using forced gender-reassignment surgery as a major plot hinge for his latest movie, “The Assignment,” is arguably a miscalculated provocation.
In a story built on multiple flashbacks and flash forwards, the viewer learns of a hired killer named Frank Kitchen (Michelle Rodriguez) who is abducted and made into a woman by a mad, disgraced plastic surgeon whose brother was killed by Frank. This is not as novel a hook as it might initially sound: At times, Mr. Hill’s movie, which he wrote with the longtime journalist Denis Hamill, plays like an EC Comics mutation of Pedro Almodóvar’s 2011 film, “The Skin I Live In.”
“The Assignment” is not overtly transphobic, as such, though I’d stand down to anyone calling it insensitive. (It’s been criticized by Glaad and other gay, bisexual and transgender groups.) But male-gaze presumptuousness is only its most immediate glaring problem. The tricksy structure doesn’t have much of a payoff (even though Mr. Hill constructs sequences with deft fluidity). And the role of the surgically altered assassin defeats poor Ms. Rodriguez. Utterly recognizable behind a fake beard during her scenes as a man, she signals her post-surgery confoundedness by making like Marlon Brando in “The Wild One” or “On the Waterfront.” (Sigourney Weaver has a better, easier time of it as the haughty surgeon.)
Because Mr. Hill is still, in most respects, Mr. Hill, a lot of the movie is more watchable than it has a right to be.

They may argue about whether our ever-proliferating political, ecological, technological and zombie-infested nightmares offer caution or consolation. Think about how bad things could get! But then again: Look how much worse they could be. Reality, meanwhile, inspires these dire visions and competes with them for sheer relentless awfulness.
All of which is to say that “The Bad Batch,” a messy, sunbaked pop-culture cobbler written and directed by Ana Lily Amirpour, is both a bummer and a blast. It conjures a bare-bones, moderately plausible near future in which criminals and other undesirables are subjected to a modern variant of the ancient practice of ostracism. After being tattooed behind the ear, members of the Bad Batch are abandoned on the far side of a border fence — we don’t know who paid for it — with a jug of water and a fast-food hamburger.
The opening sequence accompanies a young woman named Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) through this process. Her possessions include a couple of pairs of skimpy shorts, some voluntary skin ink and a sullen attitude. She wears the Bad Batch designation as a badge of honor.
But Arlen and the audience quickly learn that there are degrees of badness in this universe. The desert castaways have organized themselves into makeshift societies, two of which figure prominently in Arlen’s subsequent adventures. First she encounters an encampment of bodybuilders who practice cannibalism and aggressive tanning amid broken-down trailers and airplane detritus. Arlen is kidnapped, drugged, chained up and invited to dinner, one limb at a time.
“Y’all are pure evil” she will say when the time for revenge arrives, and while it’s hard to argue — the knowledge has literally cost her an arm and a leg — nothing is quite as simple as that. One of the people-eaters is a cute little girl named Honey (Jayda Fink) with a nonpredatory fondness for bunnies. She and her dad (Jason Momoa) — a taciturn, muscular dude identified as Miami Man by the letters inked on his chest — become part of Arlen’s initially feckless, increasingly determined existence. They serve as reminders of her own inconvenient humanity.
On the other side of an expanse of sandy flats, not too far from where the cannibals congregate, is a place called Comfort. A muttering wanderer (an unrecognizable Jim Carrey) deposits Arlen outside its gates. The residents of this relatively benign zone are kept safe by armed guards and ramparts made of shipping containers and kept happy with hallucinogens and dance music. The D.J. is played by Diego Luna. The patriarch of Comfort — church, state and pharmaceutical industry all at once — is a philosophical fellow with a droopy mustache and a retinue of pregnant concubines. He is played by Keanu Reeves.
That fact alone might be reason enough to brace yourself for episodes of shocking violence and spend some time in Ms. Amirpour’s world. Mr. Reeves in middle age is never not interesting, and he invests this role with the perfect alloy of gravity and goofiness. Happily, “The Bad Batch” is much more than a sacrament for devotees of the Higher Keanuism. It is a fluent and knowing pastiche of genres and styles with a brazen and vigorous wit of its own.
Ms. Amirpour’s 2014 debut feature, the Persian-language feminist vampire melodrama “A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,” has already acquired a cult following. Like that film, which had traces of Jim Jarmusch, David Lynch and Aki Kaurismaki in its DNA, “The Bad Batch” is not shy about showing its influences, which appear to include “Mad Max,” “Kill Bill” and the lean, mean ’50s oaters of Budd Boetticher.
But Ms. Amirpour’s films are more than a sampling of her DVD collection; her engagement with familiar themes and classic tropes is as critical as it is admiring. “The Bad Batch,” a tale of vengeance, violence, power and redemption built on the ethical foundations of the traditional western, scrambles and satisfies expectations at the same time. Arlen walks a well-trodden path from outlaw self-preservation to righteousness, with interludes of lust, confusion and drug-enhanced stargazing. She veers toward some stereotypes and refutes others, keeping herself and the viewer in a state of perpetual unbalance.
“The Bad Batch” traffics in images and situations that evoke what used to be called exploitation movies, reveling in its own (and its heroine’s) anarchic, transgressive energy. As such, it’s good, dirty fun. But it also takes exploitation — of bodies, of feeling, of labor — seriously.

"245" "The Ballad of Lefty Brown" "12/15/2017" "12/14/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/movies/review-the-sidekick-as-hero-in-the-ballad-of-lefty-brown.html" 0 "“Sorry don’t get it done.” With that line, the likable, easygoing western “The Ballad of Lefty Brown” tips its battered cowboy hat to its genre influences. John Wayne delivers that same admonition in “Rio Bravo,” Howard Hawks’s 1959 masterpiece about a sheriff and a ragtag group holding off a powerful, autocratic rancher. (Wayne’s sheriff is chiding his alcoholic deputy, played by Dean Martin.) In large and small ways, that film and other classics from the western canon inform “Lefty Brown,” which opens one dark, stormy night in the Montana territory in 1889, the year it became the 41st state.
One of the foundational themes of the western is the making of America, an origin story that plays out in tales about frontiers, borders, wagon trains, settlements, railroads, towns, cowboys and Indians. Invariably, these are narratives of violent transformations in which land becomes property and some people become citizens while others remain outlaws or are turned into permanent exiles. In “Lefty Brown,” those changes have already affected a Montana rancher, Edward Johnson (Peter Fonda), who has recently been elected a senator and is headed east. He’s a classic type, the outsider as insider who, as he tells his wife, Laura (Kathy Baker), is “going to take on all of Washington.”
Some 10 minutes into the film, though, a villain fatally derails Edward’s plans, spurring the story forward and igniting its slow-burning mystery. Laura accuses Edward’s longtime hand, Lefty (Bill Pullman), of failing her husband. (“You were supposed to watch his back,” a grieving Laura tells an apologetic, equally bereft Lefty. “Sorry don’t get it done.”) Lefty sets off to find Edward’s killer, a quest that becomes a journey and leads him straight into trouble. He soon meets an inexpert traveler, Jeremiah (Diego Josef), who has killed his own horse. All Jeremiah knows of the West are the romantic myths that he has learned from tattered dime novels, some of which feature fictionalized tales right out of Lefty’s past.
The writer-director Jared Moshé takes his time in “Lefty Brown,” which meanders here and there for close to two hours, ranging over picturesque, Big Sky landscapes while rambling deeper into prickly narrative complications. If there isn’t much urgency it’s partly because Lefty has been rather too closely modeled on the irascible if endearing coots played by the likes of Walter Brennan. Often grizzled comic relief, though sometimes tragic, these sidemen stand in the long, tall shadow of the hero, giving him grief while always following his lead. They’re loyal dogs, surrogate nannies, maybe close pals. They’re types that need more to carry a movie than Mr. Moshé has given Lefty.
Like Brennan’s character, Stumpy, in “Rio Bravo,” Lefty has a noticeable limp and the pitch of his voice periodically slides to lightly comedic heights. (You can hear a bit of Slim Pickens’s warble, too.) At times, Lefty seems like the sum of his inspirations, which remains true even as the film progresses and settles into its groove. Central to the movie’s modest pleasures is how it engages with screen history; at the same time, as the too familiar story of good men and bad, loyalty and betrayal emerges, these allusions can remind you that you’re not watching Howard Hawks. Instead, Jim Caviezel and Tommy Flanagan ride up, and the plot continues to thicken amid firing guns.
Mr. Pullman, his good looks obscured by chiaroscuro shadows and mutton chops, keeps you tethered to Lefty even when the rambling turns to drift. Mr. Moshé knows his genre. There’s beauty in his panoramas and charm in his reflexive gestures, typified by Jeremiah’s love for the mythic heroism that foreshadows his and Lefty’s future. Yet self-consciousness is also a hallmark of this genre; Douglas Fairbanks’s would-be cowboy reads dime novels in the 1917 film “Wild and Woolly.” Even so, while Mr. Moshé’s ambitions can be frustratingly modest, he does know that — however fraudulent the genre’s myths — the image of a man riding a horse into the sunset is in our cinematic DNA." 0.9979595 "Western" "R" "A24" "" "$15,598 " "$21,908 " "$66,000,000 " "2,545" "12-Feb-99" "" "" NA
"246" "The Beguiled" "6/30/2017" "6/22/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/movies/the-beguiled-review-sofia-coppola.html" 0 "“The Beguiled,” Sofia Coppola’s new film, looks like a historical drama — it’s set in Virginia during the Civil War — but it often behaves more like a fairy tale. In the first scenes, a young girl ventures out into the woods to collect mushrooms and finds a strange man under a tree: a Union soldier with a badly wounded leg and a charming Irish brogue. Is he a prince or an ogre? (He’s Colin Farrell, which may or may not clarify the issue.)
That is only one of the questions that hover in the humid, crepuscular air. The soldier, Cpl. John McBurney by name, finds himself convalescing in a plantation house, formerly a girls’ boarding school, occupied by his rescuer, Miss Amy (Oona Laurence) and her teachers and classmates. The matriarch of the group — there are six of them in all — is Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman), who occupies an intriguing middle ground between fairy godmother and wicked stepmother, a zone that is familiar real estate for Ms. Kidman.
Is McBurney a prisoner or a guest? Is he a threat to his hosts or is it the other way around? Who is beguiling whom? Ms. Coppola approaches these matters with her signature mix of intensity and detachment. Decorum is observed — grace is said before meals; corsets are tightened; French verbs are conjugated; everyone is called “miss” — but under the surface all kinds of strong emotions seethe and simmer. Even at midday the place has a gloomy, twilight quality. (The cinematographer is Philippe Le Sourd.) Mist and cannon smoke from a distant battlefield hang amid the Spanish moss. The atmosphere is too genteel to be gothic, but it is haunted nonetheless, by intimations of disorder, lust and violence.
“Nous sommes des filles” the girls recite during their lessons, and “The Beguiled,” which remakes and revises Don Siegel’s 1971 film (with Clint Eastwood in Mr. Farrell’s role), is in part an essay on the nuances and paradoxes of femininity. It’s also the portrait of a group of ladies sorted by type and temperament. Miss Amy is sharp-witted and intellectually curious. Miss Jane (Angourie Rice), the princess of the group, is imperious and judgmental. Miss Emily (Emma Howard) is openhearted and obliging. Miss Alicia (Elle Fanning) is sullen and sneaky. Miss Edwina (Kirsten Dunst) applies herself to her duties with an air of disappointment. They find themselves competing for McBurney’s favor as he sets about manipulating their vanities and insecurities, smiling like a tomcat who has stumbled into a cage full of canaries.
Like many of the characters in Ms. Coppola’s other films, Miss Martha and her charges dwell in a realm apart from the ordinary world, a gilded bubble that is both cocoon and prison. Some of this is a matter of circumstance. Versailles in “Marie Antoinette,” the Chateau Marmont hotel in “Somewhere,” the Tokyo Hyatt in “Lost in Translation” and suburbia in “The Virgin Suicides” and “The Bling Ring” — all of these are environments designed to quarantine their privileged residents from the disorder and misery of life.
But Ms. Coppola also chooses to emphasize this removal, to narrow the perspective of her films by turning her gaze away from certain complications. In the case of “The Beguiled” this means that the war and its causes are banished to the margins. Occasionally a Confederate officer will show up at the gate, and the military situation sometimes arises in conversation, but the conflict is more a premise than a subject. It could be a natural disaster or a zombie-movie epidemic — a background event that provides atmosphere and structure rather than meaning.
For this reason, “The Beguiled” has generated some controversy, in particular for omitting all but the most cursory mention of slavery. While this doesn’t strike me as an unfair criticism — as Corey Atad points out in Slate, an onscreen note explaining that “the slaves left” carries understatement to the point of historical irresponsibility — it also risks applying a standard that may not be entirely relevant to Ms. Coppola’s concerns.
I say “may not” because her intentions are somewhat opaque. This “Beguiled” (based, like the Siegel-Eastwood version, on Thomas Cullinan’s novel) is a study in moods and implications, picking up difficult, volatile themes and then carefully putting them down again. The earlier film is a bracingly pulpy product of its moment, a time when American movies were breaking free of repressive codes and reveling — sometimes wallowing — in sexual display and rough violence. It’s smutty and disturbing and feverish, rooting around in the muck of the unconscious and the mess of the American past and digging up all kinds of disturbing stuff.
None of that applies to Ms. Coppola’s film, which is less interested in battling repression than in observing its mechanisms and arguing, quietly and unmistakably, for its virtues. Her “Beguiled” is less a hothouse flower than a bonsai garden, a work of cool, exquisite artifice that evokes wildness on a small, controlled scale.
I have called the film a fairy tale but you could also describe it as a horror movie, a quasi-western and a revenge melodrama, perhaps too many things at once. Most effectively, though — and largely thanks to Ms. Kidman’s regal, witty performance — it’s a comedy, a country-house farce about the problems caused by an inconvenient guest." 0.800053994 "Drama" "R" "Universal" "" "" "$1,100,000 " "" "" "" "" "" NA
"247" "The Belko Experiment" "3/17/2017" "3/15/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/movies/the-belko-experiment-review.html" 0 "“The Belko Experiment” is a grisly, sick-making exercise in sadism that tries to camouflage its base venality in a thought-experiment plot. The movie opens on an unusual day at the Colombian outpost of the Belko Corporation: Heavily armed security guards and bomb-sniffing dogs monitor the gates, and send certain staff members back home.
Shortly after the workday starts, an announcement over the P.A. instructs the staff to kill two people in the next half-hour — or else more will die at the command of an unseen force who can kill with the flick of a switch. Then metal shutters and walls seal off the building, and the 80 nervous employees realize this isn’t a practical joke but rather a kill-or-be-killed game. The potheads at the bottom of the corporate ladder start screwing things up for everybody, while upper management (Tony Goldwyn, abetted by some twisted minions) takes the homicidal initiative.
Directed by Greg McLean (whose 2005 film, “Wolf Creek,” had a similar morbid interest in bullying its audience) from a script by James Gunn (currently relegated to delighting adolescents of all ages with the “Guardians of the Galaxy” franchise), the movie might have been better served by a director not hellbent on rubbing pretty much every head wound in the viewer’s face. Mr. McLean, perhaps determined to leave no cliché unturned, also wallows in the cheap and hackneyed irony of choreographed slaughter accompanied by Dvorak and Tchaikovsky.
The “Animal Farm” meets “Texas Chainsaw Massacre” climax yields some clever twists. But “The Belko Experiment” made me think that maybe it’s time to stop trying to solve the trolley problem (that is, do you sacrifice one life to save five workers from being killed by a runaway train?) and start worrying about the people who invent such conundrums." 0.091051142 "Action" "R" "BH Tilt" "$5,000,000 " "$4,137,230 " "$10,166,820 " "" "17" "9-Sep-16" "15-Sep-16" "7" 1
"248" "The Big Sick" "7/14/2017" "6/22/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/movies/the-big-sick-review-kumail-nanjiani.html" 1 "Love means having to say you’re sorry — early and often. That’s one of the truisms in “The Big Sick,” a joyous, generous-hearted romantic comedy that, even as it veers into difficult terrain, insists that we just need to keep on laughing. Outwardly, the story seems familiar: A really nice guy falls for a woman he may not be worthy of and nearly blows it. What gives the movie both fizz and sting — and shows that there’s plenty of juice and possibility left in the American romantic comedy — are its particulars, especially the comic Kumail Nanjiani, who plays a fictionalized version of himself, a Pakistani-American struggling to make it in stand-up while fumbling through the rest of his life.
Mr. Nanjiani (who shares his name with his character) plays a 30-ish guy navigating these two seemingly irreconcilable worlds and identities. A fledgling Chicago stand-up, Kumail is a regular at a club where, alongside his comrades — played by the real-life funny people Bo Burnham, Aidy Bryant and Kurt Braunohler — he routinely tries to make a roomful of people laugh. One evening, he teasingly mixes it up with a customer, Emily (a wonderful Zoe Kazan), a jittery charmer with a mile-wide smile whom he soon makes moves on. Flirtation leads to one and then another night together, and before long, they’re frolicking in one of those time-is-passing montages.
The real Emily is Emily V. Gordon, who’s married to Mr. Nanjiani. They wrote “The Big Sick” together — it was directed by Michael Showalter — creating comedy and drama from their lives. The story tracks the giddy start of their relationship, with its dazed smiles and intimacy, a romance that seems to collapse when she discovers that he hasn’t told his family about her. Kumail’s parents (Anupam Kher and Zenobia Shroff, both great), who live within dining distance, are trying to find him a wife and have been parading appealing prospects before him. He wants to please his folks, but he’s falling for Emily. He can’t decide what to do, so she breaks it off, but then falls gravely ill.
The movie’s title is a giveaway: Emily’s sickness is big, as well as terrifying and confounding, and it lands her in an intensive care unit, hooked to life support. Before long, she is in an induced coma; Kumail’s doe eyes are watering; and you’re wondering, wait, isn’t this supposed to be a comedy? It is, and through sickness and nearly death, it remains a very funny one, too, producing a wide range of laughs, from staccato titters to abrupt guffaws and huge, body-shaking bursts. The ratio of jokes to screen time is satisfyingly high, and there are few stretches that aren’t enlivened by humor that, joke by joke, with silliness and caustic asides, also deepens the movie.
In his stand-up, Mr. Nanjiani tells longish, confessional tales about, say, his attempts to be cool in school or watching a pornographic videotape in his parents’ home in Pakistan when the power went out. He can’t get the tape out of the VCR, so he decides he has to “pack my bags and walk the earth, which sucks because I love my parents and I’m 12 years old.” Taken out of context, of course, any given sentence in this kind of circuitous, long-form amble doesn’t sound especially funny. But Mr. Nanjiani builds the bit artfully, aided by a stealthy persona that comes across as perfectly ordinary until he deploys a puckish smile, revs up his adenoidal whine and gets his heavy eyebrows dancing.
As he does in his stand-up, Mr. Nanjiani, who immigrated to the United States when he was a teenager, mines the comedy of cultural difference in “The Big Sick” with a light, sharp touch. In another, earlier bit, he talks about a roller-coaster ride, which he calls the scariest experience of his life, adding, “and I grew up in Pakistan.” In the movie, he drops a few terrorist-themed jokes so lightly that you’re caught off guard as much by his casual delivery as by the actual gags. You sense that he’s probably heard every ugly joke about Muslims imaginable, and so he’s learned how to get there first, staking a claim on a contested subject, finding humor and strength in other people’s stupidity.
In some ways, “The Big Sick” plays like an extended version of one of Mr. Nanjiani’s anecdotal tales, though one streaked in tears and featuring a cast that includes the perfectly paired Holly Hunter and Ray Romano as Emily’s parents. Mr. Showalter, whose movies include “Hello, My Name Is Doris,” isn’t much of a visual stylist — the look of this movie is basically functional plus — but he’s terrific with actors and understands that even minor characters should be people, not background. In “The Big Sick,” you vividly see the person in each role, from nurse (Myra Lucretia Taylor) to would-be bride (Kuhoo Verma), which enriches the emotional texture and underlines that there’s something at stake.
Ms. Kazan’s work here is pivotal, especially given that she needs to make a lasting, expressive impact with Emily before the character disappears, and the narrative center of gravity shifts squarely to Kumail. In other words, you need to fall for Emily as much as Kumail does while she pokes and prods him, encouraging him to come out and play. When he’s offstage, Kumail can seem as if he were waiting for something to happen, and when her parents arrive in Chicago, he recedes, turtle-like, creating a recessiveness that makes some of his deadpan discomfort even squirmier. Mostly, Mr. Nanjiani and Ms. Kazan look and sound — and, importantly, feel — like people, like people you know and might fall for.
I fell hard for both Ms. Kazan and Mr. Nanjiani and “The Big Sick,” which tells a great story with waves of deep feeling and questions of identity and makes the whole thing feel like a breeze. Comedy is said to be hard; mostly, I think, by comics. Romantic comedy is apparently even tougher, at least from recent onscreen evidence. Few filmmakers know how to fit contemporary men and women, straight or gay, into narrative forms that were developed once upon a time. In “The Big Sick,” Mr. Nanjiani and Ms. Gordon vault over that hurdle with openness and delight, revitalizing an often moribund subgenre with a true story of love, death and the everyday comedy of being a 21st-century American." 0.699095636 "Comedy" "R" "Lionsgate" "" "" "$42,873,127 " "" "588" "16-Aug-91" "" "" NA

Based on the true story of Duleep Singh, the last maharajah of Punjab, “The Black Prince,” written and directed by Mr. Raz, never finds a rhythm. Worse, Duleep (Satinder Sartaaj) remains a handsome cipher, brooding in the shadows of his own story until, upon occasion, someone thinks to ask, “What troubles you?”
His troubles are many: He was forcibly taken from Punjab as a boy and has lived in exile in England, where he has become a Christian like his guardians. And though Queen Victoria (Amanda Root, wasted) has taken him under her wing, Duleep wants to see his mother again. And he wants to be a Sikh. And he wants to rule Punjab.
A dramatic life does not necessarily a dramatic film make. Some of this story is told in quick flashbacks; but most of it unfolds in conversations in handsome period settings. Throughout, the characters’ interior lives are opaque. At one point Duleep, returning from a thwarted trip to India, stops in Cairo. Handing out diplomas at a girls’ school, he spies a beautiful young woman. Cut to: They have tea. Cut to: They’re married. Cut to: They have three children. Soon, more brooding. (“Sir, something sits heavy on your mind.”)
The movie perks up briefly when the great Shabana Azmi appears, playing Duleep’s mother, a woman losing her sight and possibly her mind.

It’s a movie whose story is aimed at the siblings of newborns — the 8-and-under crowd, more or less. They’ll follow the plot for most of the way; they just might be puzzled by their accompanying parent’s reactions. “What’s so funny, Dad?”
That’s because the title character is voiced by Alec Baldwin, and all of his various past personas, especially the one from “30 Rock,” somehow make hearing his distinctive voice coming from a cartoon infant all that much funnier.
The story, based on a picture book by Marla Frazee, is told from the viewpoint of Tim (Miles Bakshi or, when he’s in narrator mode, Tobey Maguire), a 7-year-old only child who is not happy when his parents (Lisa Kudrow and Jimmy Kimmel) tell him a brother is on the way. Tim has a vivid imagination, and in his eyes the baby arrives wearing a business suit, bosses his parents around and has dubious intentions.
The contrast between the helpless-infant stage of life and corporate-speak is funny but fairly high-concept for a kiddie movie, and the plot grows denser as it goes along and the baby and Tim reluctantly join forces to stop a conspiracy by which puppies would corner all the love in the world. The film, directed by Tom McGrath (“Megamind,” the “Madagascar” movies), is also full of homages and such that no young child is going to get.

But I think “The Breadwinner” is worth celebrating, in part because it is a work that in some ways qualifies as reportage.
Deborah Ellis, the Canadian author on whose children’s novel this movie is based, traveled in the late ’90s to Pakistan, where she interviewed Afghan refugees fleeing war and Taliban rule. The hero of her book and its sequels is Parvana, a young girl we first see in this movie with her father, an out-of-work teacher. They are selling some prized possessions in a market square when Parvana’s father is arrested without charges.
Forbidden by roaming Taliban from so much as walking outside by herself, Parvana disguises herself as a boy to provide for her mother, older sister and baby brother. As she deals with ever-mounting difficulties, she expands on a story she and her father had started to concoct before his arrest. Depicted in cutout animation style, it tells of a young prince out to confront an elephant king.
Harsh disappointments befall the characters, and they are depicted frankly, but in a way that encourages young viewers to form an affinity with the characters rather than cringe at terror. The director, Nora Twomey, has a nuanced way with characterization and action, and the voice cast, led by Saara Chaudry of “Degrassi: The Next Generation,” is terrific. In its alternating of Parvana’s day-to-day struggle with the tale she tells herself, the movie doesn’t promote bromides about stories and storytelling transcending reality.

Opening with an intentionally mystifying scene of mass murder in the late ’60s, the movie shifts to the present day, and a familiar scenario: three college students, Elliot (Douglas Smith), his girlfriend, Sasha (Cressida Bonas), and his best pal, John (Lucien Laviscount), have rented a spacious off-campus house. Their “sensitive” (that is, psychic) friend, Jenna Kanell, feels the place has problems.

So credit “The Circle” with ambition, at least. This film, directed by James Ponsoldt, is an adaptation of Dave Eggers’s 2013 novel, and the two collaborated on the screenplay. Mr. Eggers’s book is both a satire and a cautionary tale, grafting surveillance-state mechanisms to a faux-progressive vision with pronounced cult leanings — a lot of its “join us” vibe feels passed down from Philip Kaufman’s 1978 version of “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” a tale set, like the one here, in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Mr. Ponsoldt’s movie begins with its heroine, Mae (Emma Watson), trapped in a stale cubicle doing meaningless dunning labor for a meaningless company; in due time, she’s doing much more high-tech “customer experience” work at the Circle, an internet service that seems to meld all the most annoying features of Google, Facebook, Twitter, you name it. Adding to the forced-extroversion fun is a new invention, a multipurpose webcam that’s the relative size and shape of an eyeball. “Knowing is good but knowing everything is better,” crows one of the company’s principals, a Steve Jobs-like visionary named Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks).
That maxim also appears in the novel, and it sticks in the craw, not least because any first-year graduate student in philosophy could demolish it. At what point did the Circle put a hiring freeze on anyone conversant with epistemology? Lampooning the simple-mindedness of utopian web clichés was arguably part of Mr. Eggers’s point, but much of that point is often muddled in the book. And it’s simply incoherent in the movie. The novel is at its most trenchantly funny when depicting the exhausting nature of virtual social life, and it’s in this area, too, that the movie gets its very few knowing laughs. But it’s plain, not much more than 15 minutes in, that without the story’s paranoid aspects you’re left with a conceptual framework that’s been lapped three times over by the likes of, say, the Joshua Cohen novel “Book of Numbers,” or the HBO comedy series “Silicon Valley.”
You’re also left with oodles and oodles of bad acting and bad dialogue. Ms. Watson has to spend way too much time looking concerned while staring at various screens. Ellar Coltrane, who was so unaffectedly appealing as he grew up onscreen in Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood,” can’t find any footing in the role of Mae’s Mr. Integrity ex-boyfriend. It doesn’t help that he has to mouth lines like “We used to go on adventures and have fun and see things, and you were brave and exciting.”
Mr. Hanks evokes an idea of avuncular visionary charm, and doesn’t have much to do beyond that. And John Boyega — playing a character who was vital in the book but whose role has been reconfigured so that his function in the movie makes no sense — mostly stands around at the rear of auditoriums, backlit, and when called upon to speak does a very creditable Denzel Washington impersonation.
The movie is dedicated to Bill Paxton, who died in February and is quite fine in the small role of Mae’s father, who’s dealing with multiple sclerosis. The dedication is a kind and considerate touch. Still, if you’d like to enjoy a movie featuring both Mr. Paxton and Mr. Hanks, I’d recommend “Apollo 13.”" 0.051400453 "Drama" "R" "Winstar" "" "$10,624 " "$13,804 " "$131,793 " "749" "16-Nov-01" "" "" NA

The enervating, would-be laugh-in “The Comedian” opens this week, presumably on the strength of its headliner, Robert De Niro. He’s ill-served by this movie, but he’s been worse elsewhere, which isn’t much of a comfort as this one drags into hour two. Like every exalted star, Mr. De Niro generates good will because of who he is and despite his ups and downs, the afterglow of his great performances enveloping him like a luminous cloud. So it takes a significantly bad movie to wipe the audience’s smile off this fast.
The setup sounds promising. Mr. De Niro plays Jackie Burke, a stand-up and ex-sitcom star on a downward slide. He’s not killing it the way he once did, and it takes only a few minutes onstage to see why: “Let’s talk about this abortion of a town you live in,” he tells one crowd. That’s his way of warming up the room, but the chill remains palpable. Jackie is an insult comic, but his barbs have no edge, no zing, no wit. (It’s unclear if they ever did.) Early on he gets a break after he attacks a heckler and the assault becomes a YouTube sensation, notoriety that earns him brief jail time and new attention.
Jail turns out to be a blip on Jackie’s modest, wobbly career upswing, beginning at a cable station where he and his enduringly patient agent, Miller (Edie Falco), meet the enemy: the younger generation. It’s a nowhere scene, but worth mentioning because it introduces a generational divide and a patronizing attitude toward women that winds throughout. The cable executive turns out to be a tough chick, Carol (Beth Malone), a brittle smiler with short hair who puts her feet up on the table where her eager minions sit like schoolkids. The meeting is a wash (it plays like a metaphor for Hollywood), but is soon forgotten down at the soup kitchen, where Jackie is doing community service.
There’s a lot of story, but mostly the filmmakers rack up the miles and Jackie wears through shoe leather moving from here to there. At the soup kitchen, he finds a sympathetic (and hostage) audience in the homeless clientele and a counterweight to the cable executive in Harmony (Leslie Mann), who’s also doing community service. Ms. Mann giggles and laughs too much, which fits Harmony’s role as a prop. She exists to humanize Jackie, hoot at his groaners and, in one scene, gaze adoringly at him while at his feet. She beds him because she has daddy issues; their age difference suggests that the filmmakers share those issues. Mr. De Niro’s old pal, Harvey Keitel, plays papa.
The director, Taylor Hackford, never makes any of this pop, which isn’t a surprise given the material. He also doesn’t give you much to look at other than street scenery and Mr. De Niro’s mug, which the actor bunches up while cycling through soft, sour moods (aggravated, exasperated), occasionally dropping a smile that might as well be a frown. It took a near-village to write the script, which is credited to Art Linson, the stand-up Jeff Ross, Richard LaGravenese and Lewis Friedman. (The stand-up Jessica Kirson, who appears in the movie, was a consultant.) Billy Crystal shows up for a heartbeat; Jimmy Walker, Charles Grodin, Richard Belzer and Cloris Leachman hang out a touch longer.
Every now and then, as when Jackie is onstage — isolated in the harsh lighting and facing down a show-me world that has become increasingly foreign to him — you can see the movie that “The Comedian” might have been. There’s a kernel of an idea here about an older performer struggling to be funny in a changed reality (its technology, its women), but to pull that off would require true, deeply felt hostility, something this movie doesn’t want or can’t risk. Jackie isn’t tough enough because the movie isn’t, so his comedic personality never gels. He’s meant to be an insult comic, but his discontent only rises to genuine anger with physical violence.

Set in the mid-1970s and loosely based on the director’s own experiences (previously explored in his stage play, “Kollektivet”), Tobias Lindholm’s screenplay sacrifices credibility for quirkiness. So when Erik and Anna (Ulrich Thomsen and a magnificent Trine Dyrholm) inherit a rambling mansion that they can’t afford to live in, and decide to create a commune to defray expenses, naturally they choose housemates whose peculiarities far exceed their incomes.
Though they provide color and friendly conflict, these folks are never more than narrative satellites, vehicles for embarrassing outbursts and sentimental health crises. Yet among the skinny-dipping sessions and eventful house meetings, Ms. Dyrholm quietly and affectingly takes Anna to the brink of despair and back again. A longtime news anchor whose career is threatened by stress and ageism and whose marriage to Erik — a crabby, self-centered professor — has begun to ossify, Anna seems the sole adult in a house filled with children. Even her wardrobe is out of sync with the other women’s floaty, hippie layers.
Like Annette Bening’s resilient matriarch in Mike Mills’s recent and delightful “20th Century Women” (which shares some thematic similarities with “The Commune”), Anna is a woman of a certain age coping with uncertain times.

Based — loosely seems altogether too generous a word — on the Stephen King series, the movie is an unappealing hash of moviemaking clichés that, after much scurrying and blathering, devolves into a generic shoot’em-up. About the only thing holding it together is Idris Elba, whose irrepressible magnetism and man-of-stone solidity anchors this mess but can’t redeem it.
Mr. Elba plays the otherworldly Roland, whose name suggests the Arthurian legend with knights and so forth. Onscreen, though, Roland basically points, shoots and serves as an overqualified babysitter for Jake (Tom Taylor), a 14-year-old with psychic powers (he “shines” à la “The Shining”) who lives here and now on what Roland calls Keystone Earth. Roland, by contrast, lives in Mid-World, an incoherent realm of foggy woods, digital boogeymen, cinematic allusions, slavering nods to Mr. King’s voluminous oeuvre and some geological formations that may cause you to uselessly flash on images from John Ford westerns. (The movie was partly shot in the Cederberg Mountains in South Africa.)
For reasons that emerge in expository blurts, Jake and Roland travel between Mid-World and the considerably less interesting Keystone Earth. Also on the move is Walter, a.k.a. the man in black (Matthew McConaughey), an amusingly dissolute supervillain who, with weary hand waves and insinuating whispers, oozes about like a Vegas lounge lizard — with a hint of the Wicked Witch of the West snap – lording over heavily armed, face-changing, blood-lusting snarlers (Jackie Earle Haley, et. al). Mr. McConaughey, topped by an artfully arranged shock of black hair and flashing some tanned chest that makes you want to whip out the gold chains, has truly developed into a Zen master of sleaze.
The title refers to a mysteriously woo-woo, sky-piercingly tall spire that somehow holds both the universe’s various worlds and its monstrous threats in check. Walter wants to destroy the dark tower; Roland intends to protect it. Jake, who tends to look as confused as the audience may feel, doesn’t yet have a mission, though giving this twerp a purpose — a kind of wee hero’s journey (“Surrender, Jake”!) — seems to be the endgame. It’s a default solution, and reads like a cop-out. After all, if Stephen King hands you a complex fiction that turns pulpy tropes into a dense mythology with its own language and heavyweight heroes like Roland, wouldn’t you run with at least some of it?
The “Dark Tower” series can be traced to Mr. King’s love of, among other inspirations, J. R. R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings” novels as well as Sergio Leone’s masterly 1966 film “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,” which I suppose explains the duster Roland wears and an empty nod to spaghetti westerns. So, there’s that. Mostly, there are clotted action scenes, gun fetishism, bad writing and stop-and-go rhythms that suggest a longer version may once have existed. The director, Nikolaj Arcel, shares screenwriting credit and blame with Akiva Goldsman, Jeff Pinkner and Anders Thomas Jensen; whatever they thought they were doing here remains as mysterious as Walter’s hair product." 0.232640537 "Action" "PG-13" "Sony / Columbia" "$60,000,000 " "$19,153,698 " "$50,701,325 " "" "1,459" "7-Apr-89" "" "" NA

For a while, this slow-burn approach by the writer and director, Simon Stone, works: Stabilized by mostly unimpeachable performances, the movie hugs the rails of credibility more tightly than its melodramatic material deserves.
Set in a declining Australian logging town, the drama swirls around Christian (Paul Schneider), a grumpy prodigal son. Returning home after 15 years in the United States, Christian is a newly sober drunk dragging an arsenal of anger and resentment. Its object is his father, Henry (Geoffrey Rush), owner of the town’s recently shuttered sawmill and imminent bridegroom to his significantly younger and absurdly gorgeous housekeeper (Anna Torv).
Separated from his long-suffering wife, Christian is made even grumpier by the marital happiness of an old school friend, Oliver (Ewen Leslie, terrific), whose familial contentment acts as a goad. Devoted to his wife and teenage daughter (Miranda Otto and a wonderfully expressive Odessa Young), Oliver, with his energy and positivity, is unprotected from Christian’s vindictiveness; he’s a mirror that Christian can’t wait to crack.
Reworking his stage adaptation of Ibsen’s play — a study of weaponized truth — Mr. Stone concocts a predictable stew of ancient transgressions and undeserved recriminations. The characters don’t have conversations so much as helpfully recite their back stories, and the long-buried secret is soon so obvious that the movie’s last-act hysteria feels forced and a little ridiculous.
Not to mention unearned, as the script barely sketches its characters before expecting us to care about their fates. Henry, in particular, is an indistinct patriarch whose charms, if he has any, remain hidden. And the great Sam Neill, as Oliver’s father, brings quite astonishing nuance to a role that requires him to do little more than care for injured wildlife.
Picking up the slack, the director of photography, Andrew Commis, communicates despair through melancholy tracking shots of lonely woods and isolated homesteads, boarded-up businesses and packing-up families. But the intimacy needed for the tragedy to resonate is mostly lacking, and Mr. Schneider is unable to make Christian more than an instrument of combustion: Having clumsily lighted the movie’s fuse, he slides into the wings. By ensuring that everyone is as miserable as he is, he proves far more reprehensible than any of the people whose lives he has so callously ruined." 0.29411176 "Drama" "Unrated" "Kino Lorber" "" "$10,087 " "$14,034 " "$42,470,000 " "1,311" "22-Jul-83" "" "" NA

The documentary, directed by Lana Wilson, follows Ittetsu Nemoto, who after a troubled adolescence became a monk, then a priest, in Japan. He settled with his wife, child and mother at a temple in Gifu prefecture where he spends nearly all his time trying to dissuade those in danger of taking their own lives.
The men and women here convey deep torment and helplessness. Mr. Nemoto occasionally asks questions, gives advice or offers reasons to live. But more often he listens, and his face registers both empathy for them and sometimes despair at his own shortcomings. “I’m sorry,” he says softly to one troubled woman as he looks away. “I’m not being much help, am I?”
His nearness to their pain takes a toll. Mr. Nemoto’s health declines as the unceasing calls and emails he receives wear on him. “I take on so much of their suffering when I’m counseling,” he says. “I can never show them how draining is it.”
Ms. Wilson resists any urge to overexplain the priest’s work or the people he encounters. Instead, she captures their forlorn expressions and records their searching questions. (Viewers seeking additional background on Mr. Nemoto can find it in an excellent article from The New Yorker by Larissa MacFarquhar, which inspired this film.) Nathan Michel’s score is haunting.
Like a haiku, “The Departure” weighs its words carefully. But silences, too, play a vital role here.

And that’s a huge problem for the movie, never mind for Stan.

It’s another story of crushed Hollywood dreams, one that unfolds through the eyes of Greg Sestero (Dave Franco), an aspiring actor who hitched himself to a phenomenon when he met Tommy Wiseau (James Franco, Dave’s brother). A would-be auteur, the real Mr. Wiseau became a minor cult figure after he released a 2003 specialty item, “The Room,” that some anointed the worst movie ever made. In time, its notoriety started to pay off; in 2013, Mr. Sestero wrote a tell-all book.
Based on that tell-all (which Mr. Sestero wrote with Tom Bissell), “The Disaster Artist” recounts both the making of a friendship and the absurdly inept movie it produced. Greg meets Tommy in acting class, where they’re both bombing out. Greg comes off as simply incompetent as he flatly fumbles through a scene from “Waiting for Godot,” one of the movie’s first jokey meta-moments. (“Let us do something, while we have the chance!,” Vladimir exclaims in “Godot,” much as Tommy soon urges Greg.) Tommy, by vivid contrast, captivates the agape class — particularly the inhibited Greg — by turning up the volume on Stanley Kowalski while thrashing about as if demonically possessed.
An odd, inexplicable friendship begins, and before long Greg and Tommy are driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, where much of the story takes place. Shacked up in Tommy’s apartment, the two men try and fail to break into the entertainment business, though Greg manages to sign with a talent agency. Hope fades, as it does, amid the sunshine and smiles, and this movie slips into idle. Tommy continues to prove his lack of talent in a very funny and terrible audition; Greg finds romance with a bartender, Amber (Alison Brie). At last, inspired by Greg, Tommy — who has mysteriously deep pockets that never seem to empty — decides to direct and star in his own movie, with Greg as backup. It’s a personal vision that eventually spirals into a mutual hallucination.
James Franco, who also directed “The Disaster Artist,” swoops through the movie like a star, one who has no idea that he never achieved liftoff. His face framed by a dramatic curtain of inky black hair and noticeably if discreetly modified by prosthetics, Mr. Franco certainly looks the part and sounds it too, having perfectly captured Mr. Wiseau’s puzzling accent and arrhythmic intonation. Yet even at its most convincing, Mr. Franco’s performance retains an interior lightness, a playfulness, including when Tommy goes emotionally dark. Mr. Franco isn’t making fun of his character, at least not entirely; rather, he’s put distance into the mix, as if to point out that Tommy is very much a self-made man, a construction.
The making of “The Room” gives “The Disaster Artist” its point and much of its broad comedy. Filmmakers love making movies about movies, and Mr. Franco is no exception. (He mined similarly reflexive terrain in the very dissimilar “Interior. Leather Bar.,” an experimental feature that he directed with Travis Mathews about the making and remaking of “Cruising.”) Mr. Franco recreates the production of “The Room” — and the escalating behind-the-scenes nuttiness — with an assured, energetic touch, some fitting burlesque and an appealing cast that includes Jacki Weaver and Seth Rogen, who gives his deadpan a workout to play Tommy’s put-upon script supervisor.
Written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, “The Disaster Artist” is a straighter, more obviously commercial-minded project than some of the other movies that Mr. Franco has directed. It’s a divertingly funny movie, but its breeziness can also feel overstated, at times glib and a bit of a dodge. In “The Room,” Mr. Wiseau comes across as somewhat menacing, with an underlying intensity that can’t be entirely laughed away. (That’s part of what makes the unwatchable almost watchable.) Mr. Franco’s performance keeps you hooked, in large degree because of its entertaining visual spectacle. Tommy’s wardrobe, for one, suggests a commitment to the 1980s and a familiarity with the defunct catalog International Male, a source for padded briefs and Jack Sparrow frippery.
Yet if Mr. Wiseau is a bona fide eccentric, he proves to be not an especially interesting one in this incarnation. The filmmakers try to complicate Tommy, including with some self-referential layering that never meaningfully develops. At one point early on, Greg and Tommy visit the site where James Dean died, a pilgrimage that at once nods to Mr. Franco’s breakthrough role as Dean and telegraphs one of the more ludicrous scenes in “The Room.” Dean becomes Greg and Tommy’s inspiration, a success story that they invoke while struggling to make it. But there’s no sense that either remotely grasps Dean’s art, which might have made their failure and “The Disaster Artist” more resonant.
Mr. Wiseau has made the most of his 15 minutes, which have already been generously extended by “The Disaster Artist.” His website for “The Room” suggests that he’s a busy man. It lists where and how you can see the film, sometimes with him in attendance. In the synergistic spirit of Disney (but with lavish misspellings), the website also features a line of tie-in products like “Room”-themed watches, backpacks, jackets and men’s briefs emblazoned with Mr. Wiseau’s name on the waistband. It’s funny and somewhat depressing, which also pretty much sums up the “The Room,” one of those cultish attractions that is so terrible it makes you wonder if the laugh finally is on us." 0.521511942 "Biography" "R" "A24" "" "" "" "" "8" "29-Aug-14" "9-Oct-14" "" NA

“The Divine Order” examines that fight for women’s suffrage in a microcosm. Directed by Petra Volpe, the film is set in a conservative Swiss town that has gone largely insulated from the spirit of the swinging ’60s. (To judge from the film’s grayish look, the locality has even escaped the decade’s tie-dyed palette.)
The movie centers on Nora (Marie Leuenberger), who, like most of the town’s women, has been cowed into keeping her opinions to herself. “The more we push, the more the men do what they want,” she tells a pamphleteer encouraging approval of the referendum. Nora’s days consist of caring for her children, indulging her proudly retrograde father-in-law and yearning to take a job that would break the monotony. If Nora’s name weren’t enough of a nod to Ibsen, her husband, Hans (Max Simonischek), addresses her as “my little bird.”
But soon Nora is moved to act. Nora’s rebellious teenage niece (Ella Rumpf) is sent to reform school and then, after she runs away, to prison. Nora reads up on the inequities of Swiss marriage law. A small act of defiance against the town’s leading female anti-suffrage finger-wagger (Therese Affolter) wins her an ally in a feisty widow (Sibylle Brunner), and soon an Italian restaurant owner (Marta Zoffoli) joins them. Their growing movement culminates in a strike that brings the town to a halt.
Taking a middlebrow, mildly rollicking approach to a serious subject, “The Divine Order” doesn’t exactly break new ground. It goes for easy laughs, like a scene in which the women attend a workshop led by a Swedish guru who teaches them a better appreciation of their anatomy. The composer, Annette Focks, supplies an array of insistent Spielbergian music cues, and the film hinges on a pair of big-speech scenes.
Still, “The Divine Order” effectively illustrates how peer pressure can influence the political process. Collective silence, whether it’s from women unwilling to publicly press for their rights or men afraid to voice agreement with their wives for fear of looking weak around co-workers, proves more of an obstacle than any opponent.

One item considered particularly risible in certain corners was a pitch to the co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment from a sort of youth consultant, averring that “NBD,” shorthand for no big deal, was popular text speak among millennials and that it should be used as dialogue in a new “Spider-Man” movie.
Sony’s latest release, “The Emoji Movie,” features among its heroes a female computer hacker who at one point shrugs off a crisis by saying “NBD.” I’m not sure if this is an indication of abject cluelessness, or if it represents what I believe some millennials call a self-own.
This film is exactly what its posters would lead you to believe it is: an animated narrative film about emoji. It tells the story of Gene (voiced by T. J.

His versatility is considered a malfunction, even, to some extent, by Gene himself. This leads the effusively smiling leader of the emoji to lobby for Gene’s deletion from the phone on which he lives.
The rationalization this movie uses for the anthropomorphization of the emoji is weak, to put it mildly. But once that has been taken care of, Gene goes on his hero’s quest in search of the cloud, where he seeks to be reprogrammed so he can do the job he takes so much pride in. He of course has a bumbling sidekick (a high-five emoji) in tow. They enlist the help of the hacker Jailbreak and move through the corridors of their phone. Much labored app humor follows.
For a long time, Hollywood has been propagating the idea that the panderingly, trendily idiotic can be made to seem less so, by polishing it up with bright shiny gloss and enlisting engaging talented performers and writers. I can’t be entirely certain of this, but I would say “The Emoji Movie” takes this notion to the outer limits of credibility. The voice cast is full of name actors, some of whom have genuine appeal. One of the screenwriters is the very astute Mike White. This movie’s “believe in yourself” message is borne out, in a perverse way, by the very fact that it even exists. And yet the whole thing remains nakedly idiotic. To add to the pain and despair of the experience, “The Emoji Movie” is preceded by a short, “Puppy,” featuring the characters from the “Hotel Transylvania” animated movies. It is also idiotic." 0.055979467 "Animation" "PG" "Sony / Columbia" "$50,000,000 " "$24,531,923 " "$86,089,513 " "" "1,852" "28-Aug-92" "" "" NA
"265" "The Exception" "6/2/2017" "6/1/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/movies/the-exception-review.html" 0 "In recent years, some movies have reopened the World War II files — especially those parts dealing with the Nazi occupation of Europe and the resistance to it — in search of gray areas and moral puzzles rather than black-and-white tales of treachery and heroism. “The Exception,” a new film based on a novel by Alan Judd, circles back to an older tradition. Apart from the swearing, the nudity and the nonmarital sex, it’s the kind of suspenseful, romantic melodrama of awakened conscience that might have been made in Hollywood or Britain in the early years of the war, before the worst of its horrors were widely known.
Those horrors are foreshadowed, of course. During a dinner party, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS (repeatedly identified for the benefit of the unschooled modern audience and played with lurid understatement by Eddie Marsan), halts conversation with an account of new mass-killing techniques currently in the R&D phase. His hosts, the exiled German Kaiser Wilhelm II (Christopher Plummer) and his wife (Janet McTeer), are put in an awkward position, since they had hoped that their guest would be their ticket back to power.
The Kaiser, a salty eccentric and a vocal anti-Semite — though hardly a vulgar, genocidal fanatic like Himmler — is languishing in a grand house in the Dutch countryside, having left his throne in Berlin after his country’s humiliation in the previous world war. He receives daily briefings on military strategy (from a loyal aide played by Ben Daniels) and likes to show visitors his collection of military uniforms. The Empress runs the household with Prussian rigor and dreams of a restoration. Her husband makes some show of sharing her fantasy but seems to prefer splitting logs, feeding the ducks and flirting with a pretty young maid named Mieke (Lily James).
She turns out to be a Jewish anti-Nazi partisan, and to complicate matters further she is the lover of Captain Brandt (Jai Courtney), a German officer in charge of guarding (and spying on) the Kaiser. The relationship between Mieke and Brandt, which begins with a smoldering exchange of glances and moves quickly from there, is the center of the film’s intrigue. Is she entrapping him? Is he exploiting her? Are they good-looking people with libidos inflamed by wartime? All of the above?
These questions matter for the plot, and for the themes that the movie, efficiently directed by David Leveaux from a screenplay by Simon Burke, wants to explore. Mieke has already suffered at the hands of the Nazis. Brandt, with shrapnel under his skin and nightmares in his head, has too. As a German patriot he is conscious of his duty and troubled by the extremism of Hitler and the SS. He detests the local SS heavy (Mark Dexter), a sadistic and humorless true believer. Brandt thinks that atrocities like the one he witnessed during combat in Poland are aberrations and that the German state and the German military are fundamentally honorable and decent. Mieke, seeing that he possesses those qualities, tries to convince him of his error. “They are the rule,” she says. “You are the exception.”
That is a stirring sentiment, and “The Exception” is a diverting and occasionally exciting film, though it is rarely disturbing or thought-provoking in ways the material might require. Mieke and Brandt, for all their sex and skulduggery, are less interesting than the Kaiser himself, a marginal player in this historical drama who nonetheless upstages everyone else.
This is partly because Mr. Plummer, at this stage in his career, takes evident delight in the flourishes and extravagances that seniority affords. His Kaiser is full of mischief and vanity, in many ways a reprehensible figure but nonetheless able to charm his way out of the contempt he deserves. He might also have deserved a tougher, riskier, more robust movie, but on the evidence here he seems to have made the most of disappointment." 0.543280082 "Drama" "R" "A24" "" "$21,351 " "$708,973 " "" "99" "15-Mar-13" "6-Jun-13" "84" 12

Consider: In 1977, the pair were launched (two, to increase the odds of success); in 1979 Voyager 1 began relaying information from Jupiter, and in 1980 approached Saturn and its moon Titan, nearly a billion miles from Earth. In 1986, Voyager 2 reached Uranus, and three years later Neptune. In 2012, Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to exit our solar system and enter interstellar space, from which it still sends signals. (Voyager 2 is en route.)
The accounts of scientists, whose enthusiasm still glows, is as wondrous as the technology seen here. Linda Morabito, a navigation engineer, recalls discovering gas plumes on Jupiter’s moon Io. “I had the first evidence of active volcanism beyond Earth,” she says, beaming. Time-lapse Voyager-eye views of planets as they get nearer convey a sense of the epiphanies experienced in mission control.
And there is catnip for dreamers, in the form of the so-called golden record enclosed on both vessels. “A message in a bottle into the ocean,” says Jim Bell, author of “The Interstellar Age” — and to alien life-forms that might find it. Each disc (complete with instructions) includes, among other things, photos; diagrams; greetings in 53 languages; 27 pieces of music from different cultures, including “Johnny B. Goode”; and the song of a humpback whale.

"267" "The Fate of the Furious" "4/14/2017" "4/12/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/movies/fate-of-the-furious-review-fast-and-furious-8.html" 0 "One of the givens of “Fast and Furious” is that the latest movie will be bigger and more enjoyably ludicrous than the last. The miniskirts will be shorter, the toys zoomier, the stunts more delirious. Yet, like every successful series, this one delivers its sleek new bits and pieces in reassuringly familiar packaging. James Bond has queen and country. Vin Diesel’s Dominic Toretto — the monotonal “Fast and Furious” paterfamilias — has cars and camaraderie, an ideal combo for movies about American outsiders whose home has always been one another.
Family is the most important word in these movies, the one that’s dropped with moist emotion and hushed Sunday-sermon reverence. It’s the idea that has held the franchise together — movie to movie, race to race, prayer to prayer — in an episodic soap about kith, kin and custom cars. It’s what connects this franchise to its fans, another kind of family, though one that pays to sit down at the table. It’s what has always bound Dom to his wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), and the rest of his crew, most crucially Brian, the cop-turned-soul-partner played by Paul Walker, who died in an off-set car collision in 2013.
The new movie’s title, “The Fate of the Furious,” seems like a nod to the lingering existential crisis created by Mr. Walker’s death, as do the tears that fall in the story. They’re shed over time but before they are, the movie does what’s expected, which is cut loose attractive characters in different choreographed formations in assorted machines and locales. Directed by F. Gary Gray (“Straight Outta Compton”), this one opens in Havana, where the young local beauties swirling around Dom and Letty move and dress more or less like the other young beauties in the series, as if they were part of a continuing global house party, this time with Che Guevara and prettily peeling buildings.
Mr. Gray, an action-movie veteran, gets that party started quickly. Dom and Letty are hanging out in the new Havana, which in this case means chatting in Spanish and English while checking out a vintage car with a boat motor under the hood. It’s a nice emblem of the movie’s old-school opener, which involves some macho posturing that leads to Dom racing in a rusted-out beater. As he drives, ripping past one classic American car after another, he clutches the wheel, the camera pointing up at him. Like a supermodel’s long legs, Mr. Diesel’s sculptured, often-bared arms are one of his trademarks, and they do a lot of work, signifying strength and command. Here, though, they shudder.
Both the old cars and Dom’s unsteadiness set up a movie that clearly still needs to contend with Mr. Walker’s death even as it delivers the goods. To that end, the filmmakers quickly isolate Dom from his crew (Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, et al.) and give him a proxy heartbreak. Elsewhere, the franchise’s increasingly most valuable players, Dwayne Johnson and the bouncy Jason Statham, take care of business, going hard and funny. Kurt Russell shows up as a man in black with a newbie played by Scott Eastwood, whose resemblance to Big Daddy Clint adds intertextual genre frisson. Charlize Theron slinks in as a villainous hacker in silly blond dreads, jetting around while doing a lot of fast, furious typing.
Punctuated by crashes and drums of doom, the movie moves to a dependable blockbuster beat, as a little exposition is followed by an action scene, and more exposition is followed by a bigger, noisier, nuttier action scene. As the cars zig and the story line zags, these sequences grow baroque, defying reason and gravity, which have progressively come under siege in this franchise. In New York, cars swan-dive off buildings or cut corners like rampaging dogs or, outfitted with Bond-like gizmos, harpoon a bucking ride. There’s an odd Melville thing going on here: In a Bond-esque battle in Russia that typifies the franchise’s expanded reach, a submarine breaches like Moby-Dick.
Zoom, crash, repeat with squealing, burning and flaming tires — it’s all predictably absurd and self-mocking, and often a giggle when not a total yawn. The tedium that sets in is a function of the blockbuster ethos in which everything must smash and ignite so that a solitary man can emerge phoenix-like to fight another franchise fight. Yet while Dom endures baptisms of fire, he is never genuinely alone. Part of the draw of the “Fast and Furious” movies has always been their multicultural cast, but the series’ strength is a utopian communitarianism that insists the group must be greater than any one man or nation. That’s why Dom will only ever be the franchise’s co-pilot; it’s the crew that rules." 0.971771982 "Action" "PG-13" "Universal" "$250,000,000 " "$98,786,705 " "$226,008,385 " "" "1,950" "1-Dec-89" "" "" NA

This movie’s hero is Endel (Mart Avandi), a champion fencer on the run from Leningrad; his wartime past, if known, would get him charged as an enemy of the people. As the film opens, he arrives in a small town, Haapsalu, where he is hired at a school and given the task of running a sports club for the students.
Soon Marta (Liisa Koppel) stumbles on him as he practices fencing in the gymnasium, and she wants to learn the sport. When he starts a fencing group, the children quickly take to it, even as they’re stuck with foils made from reeds in a nearby marsh. But the principal (Hendrik Toompere) fears that fencing isn’t appropriately proletarian. (While the character may be a stooge, it might have been helpful to give him at least one scene of doing something other than thwarting or sneering at Endel.)
The director, Klaus Haro, films the proceedings involvingly enough, particularly when it comes time for the inevitable tournament; his flowing camera moves might be correlatives to the careful balancing required by fencing.

In his new movie, “The Foreigner,” which he also helped produce, he loses his joie de vivre soon after the opening credits.
Here he plays a single father named Quon, who, as the movie opens, is seen dropping off his daughter at a boutique in London so she can buy a dress for a dance. Then a terrorist bombing blows the block to smithereens and turns Quon into an aspiring avenger. After facing roadblocks with the local authorities, he trains his sights on Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan), an Irish political operative who, Quon is convinced, knows something about the “authentic I.R.A.” that is claiming responsibility for the bombing.
What’s that, you ask? “Authentic I.R.A.?” Why, yes, apparently. In this film’s convoluted scenario, jam-packed with morally bankrupt people doing ugly things to one another, a Northern Irish faction is making an aggressive comeback. The movie, directed by Martin Campbell, is based on a novel called “The Chinaman,” by Stephen Leather, whose I.R.A.-heavy plot may have made sense when it was written in 1992. This boneheaded update practically defines the term scab picking.
But back to the action: Cryptically, and implacably, demanding names of the perpetrators, Quon pursues Hennessy to his country home and makes like a senior-citizen Rambo in the woods. Mr. Chan is in his early 60s, and he doesn’t deliver the action pizazz here that he used to. Nor, frankly, does he summon enough gravitas to be persuasive in the role of a grief-maddened father.

"270" "The Founder" "1/20/2017" "1/19/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/movies/the-founder-review-michael-keaton-mcdonalds.html" 0 "Ray Kroc, the whirling center of “The Founder,” doesn’t come across as a meat-and-potatoes man — much less a mogul destined to peddle burgers and fries. As played by Michael Keaton, an actor who generates terrific centrifugal force, Ray seems more like a guy who fuels up on 10 cups of coffee before calling it a night with a bottle of Scotch. “The Founder” never figures out what makes him spin and run and keep on running, but it does give you Mr. Keaton zinging around like the Road Runner. His kinetic performance doesn’t enhance the movie; it is the movie.
The real Ray Kroc (1902-1984), as business-school students and more than a few fast-food consumers might know, is the entrepreneur who put the big numbers on the McDonald’s sign. In the 1950s, that number was a lowly one million, but has since been replaced by the unfathomable, somewhat terrifying “billions and billions.” Kroc liked to call himself the founder of McDonald’s. His memoir, “Grinding It Out: The Making of McDonald’s,” promises that it is “The personal story behind founder Ray Kroc’s amazing success!” Some of that sentence is true; the success part is, at any rate. Certainly it was a McGreat success, though one larded with McFibs.
A cautious revisionist job, “The Founder” tells an old-fashioned sweet-and-sour fable of good American capitalism versus bad, and how Ray Kroc built his fortune by steamrolling Mac and Dick McDonald — the brothers who built the first McDonald’s — before going in for the corporate kill. History has at times portrayed these brothers as naïve, almost as patsies. “The Founder,” by contrast, suggests that the McDonalds weren’t remotely rapacious enough to fend him off. They’re proud and satisfied by what they’ve built and the warm, mournful performances of Nick Offerman as Dick and the invaluable John Carroll Lynch as Mac are arguments for decency. (That’s nice, but this is still all about Ray.)
“The Founder” opens in 1954 with Ray racking up miles selling milkshake mixers. He has his pitch down cold, but the customers aren’t buying. His fortunes change when he comes across a bustling burger joint in San Bernardino, Calif., called McDonald’s, where crowds of smiling customers sail through fast-moving lines. He’s impressed by the turnout, but he’s more taken with the seamless efficiency of the McDonalds’ Speedee Service System. The brothers bring Ray into their business, showing him how it’s done, not realizing that they’ve invited a snake into their garden. Mr. Keaton nearly levitates off the floor in moments like this, creating a contact high.
The director, John Lee Hancock, keeps things overly neat and tidy (it all shines or gleams), but he also keeps the story humming even when business talk threatens to slow it down. Like Ray, he seems lifted by the McDonalds, and there’s real heart and pleasure in a flashback  in which they figure out their system’s choreography, moving young, confused workers around like chess pieces. The McDonalds’ introduction of Fordism to their business turned employees into factory workers and changed the restaurant industry, though the movie elides the global stakes. Mostly, it sticks to milestones and showdowns up until the handshake deal that changed everything.
Mr. Hancock tends toward needless fussiness, overshooting and overcutting when he should let the camera run. (I lost count of all the angles he uses to show Ray reading a map.) That’s too bad because some of the movie’s best moments involve Ray alone, including a scene in which — in boxer shorts, a bottle nearby — he drops the needle on a motivational record. As an actor, Mr. Keaton often comes across as jittery as a thoroughbred at the gate, so when he goes still it feels as if something important is happening. Ray remains an unanswered, not especially compelling, question, but Mr. Keaton comes close to making you believe there’s soul to go with the fries and freneticism.
As Ray’s ambition grows, he also grows more self-interested, adapting a purely instrumental approach to other people that seeps into his home life. One truism about great-man movies is that you can’t have one without a nagging or a loving wife. Ray has both. Laura Dern plays Ethel the nag, the starter wife who enters frown first. Ms. Dern does what she can with bad lighting, drab surroundings and an underconceived character. As Joan, Ray’s third wife, Linda Cardellini fares better. For one thing, she gets to smile (she lights up the room and Ray), wears pretty clothes and enjoys the fruits of his achievements. (The second Mrs. Kroc, Jane Dobbins Green, remains M.I.A.)
Filmmakers used to polish up a halo to tell a great man’s story; now they tend to carefully complicate the picture, underscoring his weaknesses and vices, boozing and philandering. Even with a few pins stuck in him, the great man remains great and very much the charismatic, triumphant individual. That’s true of Ray, too, who for all his bad deeds never comes across as a true heavy. Mr. Keaton is good company, for one, and villainy just doesn’t work in entertainments like this, which can’t risk turning us off. Happily, there are always lawyers, in this case, Harry J. Sonneborn (B. J. Novak), who slithers up to Ray to explain where the money is.

"271" "The Glass Castle" "8/11/2017" "8/10/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/movies/review-the-glass-castle.html" 0 "“The Glass Castle” wrestles with two conflicting impulses: the longing for order and the desire for wildness. The main object of that ambivalence is Rex Walls, a big-talking, big-dreaming ne’er-do-well played with the usual guile and gusto by Woody Harrelson.
Rex would qualify as a helicopter parent if that phrase referred to someone who encouraged his kid to pilot a chopper without proper training or safety equipment. If he and his wife, Rose Mary (Naomi Watts), don’t go quite that far, it may only be for lack of available aircraft. Their four children are, to use another slightly anachronistic idiom in reference to a story set mostly in the ’60s and ’70s, decidedly free range. At a swimming pool, Rex throws Jeannette, his second-oldest daughter, into deep water to teach her to swim. That’s hardly the craziest thing he does, but it’s a convenient metaphor for his approach to parenting.
Jeannette, played in middle childhood by a wonderfully shrewd and watchful young actress named Ella Anderson, will grow up to be played by Brie Larson and to grapple with adulthood in late-’80s New York, where she writes a gossip column. Eventually, she’ll also write a best-selling memoir of her hectic childhood, which has now been adapted into this uneven, conscientious film, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and written by Mr. Cretton and Andrew Lanham.
Lacking the book’s episodic sprawl and psychological nuance, their movie clings to its essential tension. Jeannette, her father’s favorite — his nickname for her is Mountain Goat — admires her parents’ free-spirited individualism even as she suffers amid the chaos of their chosen way of life. Money is always short, and the family often picks up and moves, one step ahead of bill collectors or law enforcement. Rose Mary paints landscapes, still lifes and portraits, while Rex, bouncing from job to job, conjures fantastical, almost-practical projects, like the solar-powered mansion that gives the movie its title.
The clan’s nomadic period, which takes up roughly the first half of Ms. Walls’s memoir, is truncated on screen, and the audience never gets a full dose of the paternal wanderlust that provides Jeannette’s childhood with its thrills and terrors. We spend more time in Welch, W.Va., Rex’s Appalachian hometown, to which he had vowed never to return. Once there, in the shadow of his sinister mother, Erma (Robin Bartlett), Rex starts drinking more and dreaming less. As his charm dissolves, he devolves from a mischievous daredevil into a ranting, tyrannical drunk.
Meanwhile, in the film’s back-and-forth time scheme, adult Jeannette tries to find a place for her past (and her parents, who are now squatting on Manhattan’s pre-gentrified Lower East Side) in her polished, professional existence. What this mostly means is trying to reconcile her attachment to Rex with her engagement to David, a sacrificial yuppie played by Max Greenfield. He’s not a bad guy, he just cares about money, material possessions and what other people think. All of that makes him, somewhat too obviously, Rex’s opposite.
While Jeannette’s attempt to deal with the men in her life provides “The Glass Castle” with a bit of drama (and some comic scenes as well), it’s frustrating to see the resourceful Ms. Larson pinioned between two showy male performers. Jeannette, the central voice and consciousness in the book, is an oddly blurred character on screen. And the film itself loses focus as it drifts toward the conventions of the coming-of-age story and the family-dysfunction melodrama.
Conformity wins out in the end. Not that Rex — or the indefatigable Mr. Harrelson — is ever really tamed. But Mr. Lanham and Mr. Cretton, who proved himself a sensitive, risk-taking filmmaker with “Short Term 12” (also starring Ms. Larson), couldn’t find a way to contain both the father’s anarchy and the daughter’s skeptical affection for him. The movie bogs down in dialogue-heavy obvious scenes, some of which refer to events in the book that didn’t make it onto the screen. It’s both too tidy and too messy, and at the same time neither quite wild nor quite sensible enough." 0.515697994 "Biography" "PG-13" "Lionsgate" "" "$4,678,548 " "$17,273,059 " "" "21" "2-Dec-11" "18-Dec-11" "17" 2.4

Set once upon a time, the movie spins a legend that never was: Every 60 years, slavering creatures emerge from beyond to sharpen their teeth on human bones and stuff their bellies on meat. The whole thing plays out as if it had been thought up by someone who, while watching “Game of Thrones” and smoking a bowl, started riffing on walls, China and production money.
The threadbare story turns on a swaggering mercenary, William (Mr. Damon), who’s trying to find what he calls “black powder,” a.k.a. gunpowder. He and a sidekick, Tovar (Pedro Pascal, from “Game of Thrones”), end up at the Great Wall, where after some macho posturing and chest thumping, they join forces with the wall’s guardians, including an English-speaking military genius, Lin Mae (Jing Tian); an adviser, Wang (Andy Lau); and an assortment of supporting glowerers (Hanyu Zhang, Eddie Peng Yu-Yen and Ling Gengxin). Willem Dafoe, the whites of his eyes shining, is there, too, slinking around as Ballard, a Western prisoner who long ago also sought the black powder.
That’s about it, plus striking locations (the Rainbow Mountains), digital wizardry and battles between hordes of critters (called Tao Tei) and legions of soldiers. These are distinguished by skill and hue, like the blue-clad Crane Corp, who bungee-jump off the wall with spears. Outside of the bromantic quipping between William and Tovar, the dialogue is aggressively simple (no frills, no poetry) and skews along the lines of “Release the Kraken” or, in this case, bring out the flaming balls of death and so forth. This seems to suit the director, Zhang Yimou (“Hero”), who lavishes much of his attention on the wall, which amusingly suggests a giant Swiss Army knife, scissors included.
Mr. Damon, wearing hair extensions and employing an on-and-off Irish accent, looks uncharacteristically ill at ease during much of this. He may be the headliner, but he’s also just one of this movie’s many, many whirring parts. “The Great Wall” flirts with romance and bleats out a little propagandistic blather about the benefits of bilateral action, but the focus throughout remains on multitudes of shifting, surging bodies — human and beast, digital and not — that, as they ebb and flow, resemble a Chinese military pageant and a lavish Busby Berkeley number. At times the effect brings to mind the German theorist  Siegfried Kracauer’s ideas about Berkeley-like revues or, as he wrote in 1927, “indissoluble girl clusters whose movements are demonstrations of mathematics.”
In such formations, bodies are abstracted into larger geometric shapes and people transform into a collective mass ornament. This transformation obviously takes on sinister meaning when such formations are adapted for, say, Nazi propaganda, as demonstrated in the film “ Triumph of the Will.”
In “The Great Wall,” though, the bodies are divided into two distinct, oppositional configurations: the raw and the cooked. On the one side are the monsters that — despite being nicely designed zeros and ones — suggest a wildness that cannot be denied. On the other are the meticulously choreographed warriors, who never seem less human than when joined together." 0.826450062 "Action" "PG-13" "Universal" "$150,000,000 " "$18,469,620 " "$45,540,830 " "" "1,354" "31-Jan-86" "" "" NA

Barnum remains firmly lodged in the public imagination because of his gift for blurring the line between truth and fiction. When he presented the 161-year-old nurse of George Washington as a star attraction, some of his audience knew she was phony, others did not, and then there were those who did not care and went along for the ride. There’s pleasure in a good fib (spoiler alert: Santa), as well as political advantage. When compared to Barnum last year, Donald Trump responded: “We need P.T. Barnum, a little bit.”
“The Greatest Showman,” a montage sequence that occasionally turns into a movie musical, steers clear of any contemporary resonance and ignores meaty themes. The first-time director Michael Gracey achieves an aggressively synthetic style through kinetic editing and tidy underdog stories, but none of the true joy of pulling a fast one. It’s a standard-issue holiday biopic, one that tells a story about a populist entertainer hungry for highbrow respect, the joys of showbiz and the price of ambition. An amusement park version of P.T. Barnum is fine, as far as that goes, but if you are going to aim for family-friendly fun, you need to get the fun part right.
“Showman” has the ingredients of a splashy good time, since it has the perfect star in Hugh Jackman, the most charismatic Broadway leading man of his generation; and songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the acclaimed duo behind the lyrics for last year’s hit movie “La La Land” (which won them Oscars) and the music for the Broadway show “Dear Evan Hansen” (which won them Tonys). But they are all awkward fits for this material. The songs, which shift from defiant pop anthems to melodramatic ballads, do not evoke the circus, or at least not the American version. Their soupy soulfulness belongs to Cirque du Soleil more than Ringling Brothers. And while Mr. Jackman is a dashing presence with an easy smile, his earnest performance could use a few knowing winks. The script doesn’t do him any favors. Its first joke is a spit-take, and it doesn’t get any wittier than that.
Not much time is wasted on Barnum’s early life. Success comes quick, soon after making his American Museum, which mixes flea circuses and bearded ladies. Then Barnum starts chasing respectability, hiring an upper-crust playwright (a colorless Zac Efron), who falls in love with an acrobat (Zendaya), and presenting on tour the opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson). His star attractions turn into a kind of chorus of eccentrics, with minimal back stories.
Playing the role of a skeptical theater critic as the joyless foil to the giddy fun inspired by Barnum, Paul Sparks maintains a stern deadpan, the way reviewers in movies do. As Barnum’s wife, Charity, Michelle Williams gazes adoringly, until rumors in the press of his affair with Ms. Lind prompt her eyelids to fall in disappointment.
The repercussions of this domestic drama are predictable, but at least they do lead to a delightful redemptive scene (one of the movie’s few pleasingly dreamlike moments), when Barnum uses an elephant as a New York taxi to make an appointment on time. It’s utter nonsense — imagine finding a parking space — but that’s exactly what a movie about the self-proclaimed “Prince of Humbugs” needs." 0.209168773 "Biography" "PG" "Fox" "$84,000,000 " "$8,805,843 " "" "" "1,358" "26-Apr-91" "" "" NA

And it’s that awareness, conveyed in every pained glance and drawled syllable, that saves “The Hero.” Without Lee’s complicity in the triteness of his story — and Mr. Elliott’s ability to sell it as a melancholy burden — this low-key feature by Brett Haley wouldn’t be half as pleasurable.
Watch Lee’s face scrunch with wry incredulity when he realizes that a gorgeous comedian half his age (Laura Prepon) is making moves on him. Later, when he hears her use his declining body as fodder for her stand-up routine, the camera braces with him for the impact of the crowd’s laughter. This refusal to soft pedal the age difference — or pussyfoot around the tragedy of withered fame — prevents the film from sinking into sentiment. And Mr. Elliott, for whom the story was written and who appears in almost every scene, lends even the most hackneyed moments a faded authenticity.
So when a cancer diagnosis propels Lee to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Krysten Ritter) and take a last stab at cementing his movie-star legacy, his journey takes on a gentle urgency. Katharine Ross makes a brief but welcome appearance as Lee’s thriving ex-wife, and the director of photography, Rob C. Givens, gives the California coastline a wistful majesty.

Ryan Reynolds is the bodyguard. What more do you want me to say? These two sometime residents of different branches of the greater Marvel cosmos — Nick Fury and Deadpool, if you need reminding — join up, with ostentatious reluctance, on a European jaunt, leaving a trail of dead minions and flummoxed law enforcement officers from Manchester to The Hague. Their common nemesis is an Eastern European despot, a genocidal maniac with a scholarly mien and personal touch played, it seems almost redundant to point out, by Gary Oldman.
“The Hitman’s Bodyguard,” directed by Patrick Hughes (“The Expendables 3”) and written by Tom O’Connor, is not a good movie, but, in fairness, it doesn’t try to be. It occupies its genre niche — the exuberantly violent Euro-action movie-star-paycheck action comedy — without excessive cynicism or annoying pretension. The stars banter and bicker and wax sentimental about the badass women in their lives (Salma Hayek and Élodie Yung) until the time arrives for the next shootout or car chase or suite of explosions.
These range from tedious to wildly overblown to kind of fun. A hot pursuit in and along the canals of Amsterdam — with Mr. Jackson in a speedboat, Mr. Reynolds on a motorbike and the bad guys in black cars — brings a few jolts and gasps, even if the digital seams in the sequence peek out intermittently. A bout of tool-assisted hand-to-hand combat in a hardware store makes up in efficiency for what it lacks in originality. The final blowup and showdown destroy whatever sense of proportion the movie might have had, along with a lot of Dutch infrastructure.
Mr. Jackson plays Darius Kincaid, a fearsome contract killer cooperating with the authorities to free his wife (Ms. Hayek) from prison. Mr. Reynolds is Michael Bryce, a formerly “triple-A”-rated security specialist whose career and relationship (with Ms. Yung’s Interpol agent) went south after he lost a client. One of these fellows is an uptight, cautious, detail-oriented professional, while the other has a looser, more improvisational style. No points for guessing which is which, or for predicting who learns what from whom.
Darius, despite a résumé piled high with dead and maimed bodies, is more righteous avenger than sociopath. This, too, is no surprise. A least since “Pulp Fiction,” Mr. Jackson has made a specialty of playing murderers touched by a curious sense of moral grace. Mr. Reynolds, for his part, is comfortable and credible as a smart, suave young punk in need of a bit of schooling. Mr. Jackson lays claim to most of the good lines and the big scenes, but no one can complain about that.
Michael, however, does object to Darius’s reliance on a certain 12-letter expletive. “You ruined it,” he whines, supplying this otherwise blunt, none-too-clever movie with a morsel of meta-humor. Every movie fan knows that Mr. Jackson didn’t exactly invent that multifaceted word, but in its modern phraseology, he is nonetheless something of a mythic figure." 0.407265523 "Action" "R" "Lionsgate/Summit" "$30,000,000 " "$21,384,504 " "$75,468,583 " "" "1,388" "22-Sep-95" "" "" NA
"276" "The House" "6/30/2017" "6/30/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/movies/the-house-review-will-ferrell.html" 0 "“The House,” a new comedy starring Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler, has arrived in theaters without advance screenings for critics. I know better than to take it personally when this kind of thing happens, but I do often wonder why it does happen. Usually the studio (Warner Bros. in this case) thinks it has a turkey on its hands, but sometimes it doesn’t know quite what it has, and sneaks an interesting movie into theaters more or less by mistake. That seems to have been the case this time.
Based on trailers and the durable, slightly stale charm of its stars, “The House” might be mistaken for a genial, silly movie about nice people making questionable decisions. Instead, it is a dark, startlingly bloody journey into the bitter, empty, broken heart of the American middle class, a blend of farce and satire built on a foundation of social despair.
It all starts innocently enough. Scott and Kate Johansen (Mr. Ferrell and Ms. Poehler) are visiting Bucknell University with their daughter, Alex (Ryan Simpkins). Mom and Dad are lovey, clingy, goofy Gen-X parents, and their kid is a high-achieving, deadpan millennial. Some borderline-inappropriate jokes are cracked and you brace yourself for 90 more minutes of semi-awkward, underwritten, marshmallow-soft humor featuring people who have been funnier elsewhere.
But then Alex loses her scholarship and her parents face a not-all-that-exaggerated version of the struggle that confronts so many families. “It’s $50 million!” Scott exclaims when he sees the tuition bill. The poor math skills that seemed at first like an arbitrary character trait were more likely invented to enable that very joke. It might as well be $50 million. Suddenly this couple, with a big house in a pleasant, generic suburban town, find themselves in a state of abject desperation.
So they team up with their pal Frank (Jason Mantzoukas) whose gambling addiction has destroyed his marriage and his self-esteem. He hopes to win back his estranged wife, Raina (Michaela Watkins) and persuades Scott and Kate to open an illegal casino in his half-empty mini-mansion. The business plan is straightforward: The house always wins.
If “The House” had been made in the ’70s, it would have reveled in the grimness of the Johansens’ circumstances and exploited the moral tawdriness of their response to it. What is most unnerving about the way their story is presented here — Andrew Jay Cohen directed, and wrote the script with Brendan O’Brien — is the absence of that kind of dramatic intensity. Scott and Kate do some terrible things, and induce their friends and neighbors to misbehave in sometimes frightening ways. Scott mutilates someone with an ax. More than one person, actually. In addition to blackjack and roulette, the casino features an occasional fight club, in which upstanding folks pair off and beat each other bloody as their fellow burghers wager money on the outcome.
The thing that will dismay some tenderhearted viewers — and that may have spooked the distributor — is the film’s steely refusal of hypocrisy. You wait for the moment of comeuppance or redemption, for the restoration of right and wrong, but no such moment arrives. The pop-culture references and musical cues that pepper the action are not as ironic as they may seem. Scenes from “The Walking Dead” and snatches of Snoop Dogg’s “Gz and Hustlas” and the “Sopranos” theme song provide clues about the reality that Kate and Scott are only partly aware they inhabit.
The town’s political leadership (represented by Nick Kroll) is greedy and corrupt. Law enforcement (represented by Rob Huebel) is stupid and belligerent. The casino becomes not only a place of recreation but also the only place where civic interactions among the citizens seem possible. It also reveals the true face of a society divided into predators and prey, the house and the suckers.
The only way to protect yourself and the people you love is to pick the right side. That seems shockingly cynical, but there is something admirable in a movie that examines some of the worst aspects of modern American life with blunt, good-humored honesty. We’re not nice people.

Ian Paisley, who spearheaded the Democratic Unionist Party (he died in 2014), and Martin McGuinness, a Sinn Fein leader (who died in March).
The film begins in October 2006, at St. Andrews in Scotland, where Britain, the Irish Republic and Northern Irish parties — including the Democratic Unionist Party (the D.U.P.) and Sinn Fein — are negotiating what was called the St. Andrews Agreement, a power-sharing pact between Unionists and Irish republicans.

Apart from a great deal of hand-held, wide-screen camera work that might be thought of as Lars von Trier-o-Vision, the movie, directed by Erik Poppe, proceeds in the manner of any number of war epics of the 1960s, sluggishly charting how the ostensibly ceremonial king acquired real negotiating power during a crisis — and had the resolve to lead his country into war.
Checking off dates and locations onscreen, and filling its dialogue with undigested exposition, the movie traces the parallel journeys of the king, who evacuates Oslo with the royal family in the face of the attack, and the German envoy, Curt Bra¨uer (Karl Markovics), who, in the film’s telling, is authorized by Hitler to bypass the cabinet and negotiate directly with the king.
Bra¨uer is alone among the German characters in his affection for neutral Norway and recognizes that Norwegians aren’t sympathetic to Germany’s desire for iron ore and a strategic coastline, or its violently proffered promise of protection from a hypothetical British invasion.
“The King’s Choice” maintains a sense of intrigue when it sticks to the king’s dealings with the government, but the movie drags when it moves outside of back rooms and deviates from setting up the Bräuer-Haakon showdown." 0.788284601 "Biography" "Unrated" "Samuel Goldwyn" "" "$727 " "$2,651 " "$1,320,199 " "190" "13-Aug-04" "28-Oct-04" "77" 11

“The Last Dalai Lama?” spends a lot of time looking back. A collection of moments rather than a linear story, this film is at its best when it’s suffused with the presence of the Dalai Lama, whether he is watching schoolchildren in Canada practice gratitude or meditating on separating his consciousness from his body in preparation for death.
One fascinating segment introduces the Atlas of Emotions, commissioned by the Dalai Lama and developed by Paul and Eve Ekman, a father and daughter who used behavioral science to map human feelings and their consequences.
Another shows Philip Glass at the organ at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York, playing music he composed for the Dalai Lama’s 1979 visit there and discussing how his own practice of Buddhism helped him as a composer.
No film about this holy man would be complete without a recap of the escape from Tibet to Dharamsala, India, after the Chinese takeover of the country. The movie notes that the Chinese government has declared it will control the selection and development of the next Dalai Lama, an absurd idea to those who believe succession is a matter of reincarnation. The specter of two competing lamas, one controlled by the Chinese, also arises. In response, the ever-smiling Dalai Lama says he won’t reincarnate as a 15th Dalai Lama, but aides explain that statement doesn’t mean he won’t be reborn in exile, and the film is unlikely to settle the question definitively." 0.823734601 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Matson Films" "" "$1,511 " "$2,241 " "$41,266 " "9" "11-Jul-08" "28-Sep-08" "84" 12

She plays Harriet Lauler, a retired advertising executive who has effectively walled herself up in a grand, immaculate house that’s a testament to her former glory but so quiet it might as well be her mausoleum. Frankly, it’s a wonder no one has strangled her yet. Unapologetically domineering, Harriet all but grabs the garden clippers from her exasperated gardener and pushes her blissfully patient cook out of the kitchen. She knows better, does better, always has, always will. Her elbows aren’t sharp; they’re lethal.
There is more to Harriet than meets the eye, of course, including secrets and lost connections, and if the movie simply stayed focused on her it might have been considerably better. The director, Mark Pellington, who scatters photos of the young Ms. MacLaine in the house like religious relics, clearly adores her. Some of the movie’s most satisfying moments show Harriet alone in her house, lingering in its empty rooms, needlessly fussing over its sterile perfection and staring into the distance. Ms. MacLaine, 82, holds the screen effortlessly.
Too bad she has to share it. The story proper begins after Harriet has a brush with death and, somewhat worriedly, decides that she needs to arrange an obituary worthy of her status. She makes a study of the genre, underlining what goes into a good death notice: friends (she has none), family (a question mark), and something unusual, a so-called wild card. This leads her to the local newspaper, which owes her for her longtime patronage, and straight to Anne (Amanda Seyfried), a reluctant obituary writer who’s dragooned into service.
It’s as counterfeit as it comes, but just when you think it couldn’t get more artificial, Harriet and Anne are joined by Brenda (AnnJewel Lee Dixon), a young black girl. Harriet more or less goes shopping for Brenda at a community center, having decided that she needs a charity case to pad out her obituary. There’s some scathing satirical potential in this setup — the privileged white doyenne exploiting black poverty — but that would require backbone, edge and honesty, none of which this movie finally has. And so Harriet, Anne and Brenda bond, smile and even dance, sharing and learning from one another with forced laughter and false tears." 0.883410443 "Comedy" "R" "Bleecker Street" "" "$31,630 " "$1,783,421 " "" "3" "10-Mar-17" "30-Apr-17" "45" 6.4

But “The Layover,” which probably scrapes by thanks to a line here or there, plays as if it were designed to thumb its nose at the concept.
Directed by William H. Macy, for some reason, and written by David Hornsby and Lance Krall, the movie concerns two longtime Seattle friends who, when not in the presence of men, watch “The Bachelor.” Kate (Alexandra Daddario) is a teacher; Meg (Kate Upton) aspires to sell luxury cosmetics, though no one is buying her North Korean imports.
To cure workplace blues, the pair hop a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and wind up seated next to Ryan (Matt Barr), their mutual masculine ideal.

His impatience was reasonable enough. Here we were, five minutes into “The Lego Ninjago Movie,” gazing at a live-action prologue with Jackie Chan, a kid and a cat in a store full of exotic knickknacks.
Soon enough, the Wegos awwived, and the latest installment in a nearly foolproof franchise was underway, a fast-moving mélange of brazen corporate promotion, winking pop-culture cleverness and earnest lesson-learning. I realize that makes this movie sound indistinguishable from nearly every other piece of family-targeted animated big-screen entertainment out there, and I’m sorry to report that the Lego movie enterprise has lapsed into intentional mediocrity.
This is especially disappointing given the conceptual wit, visual flair and bonkers imagination of “The Lego Movie” and the sweet silliness of “The Lego Batman Movie.” “The Lego Ninjago Movie,” directed by Charlie Bean, Paul Fisher and Bob Logan from a script with an army of credited authors, attaches itself to some of the tropes and images of Asian action cinema with sloppy affection. Mr. Chan, who voices a wise and venerable teacher in addition to playing the wise and venerable shopkeeper, doesn’t really belong to the ninja genre. But neither do the young fighters who protect the city of Ninjago from an evil four-armed warlord named Garmadon, voiced by Justin Theroux. They prefer big, noisy machines to stealth, guile and swordsmanship.
Garmadon, who wants to be a mayor, is a megalomaniac whose regular assaults on peace and normalcy are breathlessly covered by the news media and whose favorite pastime is firing his underlings. His estranged teenage son, Lloyd (Dave Franco), is ostracized and mocked for being the child of such a monster. But Lloyd, whose alter ego is the Green Ninja, works behind the scenes to check his father’s worst tendencies. Does every movie have to be a political allegory now? Can’t we just have fun?
Not as much as we’d like to. The Lego figures are rendered with playful rigor; their limited movements and expressions generate some amusing sight gags. But the physical world they inhabit is more of a generic digital-cartoon space than a snapped-together environment. And the themes they explore are tired, cynical, sub-Disney bromides about family reconciliation and self-discovery.
A dollop of mawkish sentiment is to be expected in this kind of movie. “The Lego Ninjago Movie” applies it in gluey globs, freezing the action so that Lloyd and Garmadon can work out their issues. For whose benefit? Children are unlikely to be captivated by this unconvincing melodrama of abandonment and reconciliation, and adults will be moved by it only because we’re hopeless crybabies.
We’re also, at least in the eyes of the committee that issued this strategy memo disguised as a movie, eager to hear the voices of cool people we watch on television. Abbi Jacobson of “Broad City,” Fred Armisen of “Portlandia” and Kumail Nanjiani of “Silicon Valley” (and also “The Big Sick”) are on sidekick duty here, to no memorable effect. Ms. Jacobson’s character, the only girl in the six-ninja squad, barely rises to the level of tokenism.
“She’s a girl and a ninja! Can she have it all?” a voice-over asks sardonically, trying to make a self-conscious joke at the expense of the movie’s own imaginative limitations. “You fellas need to inform yourselves on where we’re at culturally,” the lady ninja retorts. It’s a good line, but also one that the writers and directors — fellas to a man — might have taken a bit more to heart.

Inspired by stories from Giovanni Boccaccio’s “The Decameron” — seasoned with a sprinkling of Monty Python — the writer and director, Jeff Baena, turns an Italian convent into a hotbed of repressed desires. Boccaccio might have had medieval audiences rolling in the aisles, but Mr. Baena squanders an R rating and a roster of household names while managing to raise little more than a smile.
At times, the atmosphere is so clubby that the actors seem to be performing mainly for one another. Centering on three irreverent nuns played by Aubrey Plaza (witchy and bitchy), Alison Brie (frustrated and snooty) and Kate Micucci (bi-curious and babyish), the goofy plot never finds its groove. Molly Shannon, in the role of senior sister, is virtually ignored; and Dave Franco’s hunky handyman is mostly just a ripped body for female characters to enthusiastically molest.
Lushly shot in northwest Tuscany by the cinematographer Quyen Tran, “The Little Hours” is saved from ignominy by two brief standout performances. Fred Armisen’s monologue as a scandalized bishop is priceless; but it’s the fabulous Lauren Weedman (who injected warmth and pathos into the thankless role of a gay man’s best friend on the regrettably short-lived HBO show “Looking”) who rises above her one-note character.

"285" "The Lost City of Z" "4/14/2017" "4/13/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/movies/the-lost-city-of-z-review-charlie-hunnam.html" 1 "In “The Lost City of Z,” a lush, melancholic story of discovery and mystery, a mesmerizing Charlie Hunnam plays a British adventurer in the Amazon who is consumed by “all the glories of exploration,” as Joseph Conrad once wrote of a different journey. Enveloped by the forest, the explorer and his crew face snakes, piranhas, insects and that most terrifying of threats: other people, who at times bombard the strangers with arrows. Undaunted, he perseveres, venturing more deeply into a world that first becomes a passion and then something of a private hallucination. It’s 1906, and while wonders like moving pictures are rapidly shrinking the world, the dream of unknown lands endures.
That dream isn’t only about the Amazon in “The Lost City of Z” but also about the movies and their ability to transport us to astonishing new worlds. For us, the Age of Discovery is long gone and, for the most part, so are old-fashioned historical epics, other than the occasional Chinese extravaganza or one of those international waxworks with clashing accents. Hollywood used to churn these out regularly, but they’ve faded, casualties of shifting industry logic, audience taste, cultural norms and other pressures. The romance of adventure has largely shifted from history to fantasy fiction, an easier, less contested playground for conquering white heroes.
In “The Lost City of Z,” the writer-director James Gray has set out to make a film in the colonial era that suggests the likes of David Lean’s “Lawrence of Arabia,” but through a sensitive, contemporary lens. It’s one that starts from the premise that while white men have long been the keepers of the historical record, they didn’t make the past single-handedly. The story that Mr. Gray has chosen seems an unlikely candidate for such revisionism because it turns on Lieut. Col. Percy Harrison Fawcett, who came to believe in the existence of a lost Amazonian civilization. He called it the lost city of Z; others called it El Dorado, a European illusion that proved catastrophic for the New World.
The movie opens shortly before Fawcett is approached by the Royal Geographical Society to map uncharted territory in Bolivia. A career soldier and son of a disgraced aristocrat, Fawcett is anxious to change his fortunes and increase his social standing. Leaving behind, rather too easily, his loving wife, Nina (Sienna Miller, wonderful), and their young son (later played by Tom Holland), he sets off and is soon struggling through the Amazon with a small crew that includes an aide-de-camp, Henry Costin (an excellent Robert Pattinson, shaggy and almost unrecognizable). Deep in a jungle, where each wonder is matched by terror, Fawcett is ravaged — and then transformed — by his discoveries of both a new world and another self.
Mr. Gray opens this world gloriously. As a director, he has an old-fashioned belief in cinematic beauty, in the charm and necessity of the perfectly lighted and framed face, the hauntingly darkened room, the grittily coarsened street. He’s a sensualist, and in “The Lost City of Z” he turns the Amazon into a ravishment for the senses. (The cinematographer, Darius Khondji, who goes dark brilliantly, shot Mr. Gray’s last film, “The Immigrant.”) As Fawcett presses on, walking and sailing through dense shadow, streaming light and canopies of variegated green, the natural world comes fantastically alive with strange animal cries, stirring trees, roiling fog and frighteningly violent eddies.
In time, native peoples emerge from those trees, by turns watchful, threatening and welcoming. Much as he does throughout his Amazonian travels, Fawcett is enlivened by his encounters with the Indians. He’s a natural, somewhat surprisingly peaceful ambassador given his background and historical moment (even if his restraint also nicely suits Mr. Hunnam’s slow-burning charisma). When his expedition comes under siege at one point, he orders his men not to fire and instead waves a kerchief while calling out “Amigo!” It’s a stratagem, but Fawcett’s curiosity is boundless and he sees accomplishment and complexity in this world, which sharply goes against bigoted orthodoxies back home.
Mr. Gray, working from David Grann’s 2009 book, “The Lost City of Z,” glosses over Fawcett’s more noxious beliefs. Mr. Grann, for one, writes that Fawcett “escaped virtually every kind of pathology in the jungle, but he could not rid himself of the pernicious disease of race.” It’s no surprise that the real Fawcett was as fascinatingly contradictory as you might expect of a Victorian-born British explorer. Mr. Gray doesn’t soften all of these uncomfortable edges — there is arrogance and tinges of cruelty in this portrait — but he’s far more interested in what seems to have distinguished Fawcett, namely his passionate belief that Amazonian Indians were not the primitives the West insisted they were.
That passion sends Fawcett back to the Amazon several more times over the years, eventually becoming a kind of steadily devouring fever. He’s hailed as a hero after he returns from his first trip, but by the time he’s home he has a new child, whose birth he missed. This sets the template for his life, as Fawcett increasingly gives himself over to the Amazon and neglects his family, a familiar divide that Mr. Gray turns into the story’s axis point. In most movies of this type, the great man kisses the little woman goodbye and sets off. Here, partly because Fawcett repeatedly returns home, Nina emerges as a substantial narrative force and not only a reminder of what he’s willing to sacrifice.
Fawcett finds ecstasy in and out of the Amazon, as does Mr. Gray, who fills the screen with intimate reveries and overwhelming spectacle, including a harrowing interlude during World War I. Until now, Mr. Gray has tended to work on a somewhat modest scale, often with art films that play with genre. Here, he effortlessly expands his reach as he moves across time and continents and in the process turns the past into a singular life. There’s much to love in this film, but what lingers are those lapidary details that often go missing in stories about great men, as if they had built the world alone and no child had ever raced down a road waving goodbye as a father disappeared into history." 0.993898652 "Action" "PG-13" "Bleecker Street" "" "" "$8,580,410 " "" "6" "10-Jul-98" "14-Oct-99" "" NA

Yet the extracurricular bonking that they gingerly enjoy — she with a needy writer (Aidan Gillen) and he with a neurotic ballet dancer (Melora Walters) — appears to bring only marginally more pleasure than their sclerotic union.
Sadly, that’s only one problem with this overdetermined, fussily managed romance. Falling with a thud between two stools, it has neither the zip nor the zaniness of farce nor the airy vivacity of the best romantic comedies. The sugary, violin-heavy score that elbows its way into virtually every scene might beg to differ, but its cudgeling chords can’t force enchantment when, improbably, Mary and Michael’s jaded passions are rekindled.
That would require a screenplay (by the director, Azazel Jacobs) with sparkle and energy instead of one that takes forever to nudge characters from staring to kissing. No one suffers more from this programmatic approach than Ms. Winger, whose warm, loamy sexiness demands roaming privileges. Only watch her in “The Sheltering Sky,” playing a dissatisfied wife who finds her true self in the middle of the desert. She’s the beating heart of that movie, turning what could have been a sterile exercise in alienation and ennui into something vibrantly human.
Which brings me to a third stool that Mr. Jacobs (who also directed and helped to write the smart, adorably prickly HBO series “Doll & Em”) could have claimed. Beneath its mushy music, “The Lovers” nurses something altogether more sour and more fruitful: a self-sabotaging desperation that you can sense Ms. Winger straining to vocalize.

Like “Shakespeare in Love” and “Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus,” “The Man Who Invented Christmas,” adapted — rather fancifully — from the nonfiction book by Les Standiford, endorses the theory that artists are secret documentarians. True, the movie doesn’t ascribe everything in “A Christmas Carol” to autobiography: Dickens also has conversations with his characters, who, led by Christopher Plummer as Scrooge, appear to him like the Christmas ghosts and help him through his writer’s block. An Irish housemaid (Anna Murphy) also gives him notes.
Brightly lit and anchored by Mr. Stevens’s infectious, live-wire performance, the film, directed by Bharat Nalluri (“Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day”), nevertheless proceeds like a television holiday special, designed to distract children while winking at their parents. Interesting historical tidbits — William Makepeace Thackeray (Miles Jupp) appears as a periodic irritant for the protagonist — share screen time with a fair amount of whimsical nonsense that explains away Dickens’s imagination, prose style and gift for names with what Orson Welles called “dollar-book Freud.”" 0.967052509 "Biography" "PG" "Bleecker Street" "" "$1,357,129 " "$5,676,487 " "" "5" "26-Apr-17" "11-Jun-17" "47" 6.7

But despite her exemplary range, many American viewers maintain an image of her as an aloof, exquisite, possibly imperious, possibly enigmatic beauty. This is largely because she looks like, well, Catherine Deneuve. The woman can’t help it. Even when portraying the needy, nearly shambolic Béatrice in “The Midwife,” Ms. Deneuve is capable of vibrating with an elegance that implies both hauteur and froideur.
Béatrice is not the title character of this film, written and directed by Martin Provost. That is Claire, played by Catherine Frot, a superb and prolific actress whose work in French cinema is not nearly as well known here as Ms. Deneuve’s is. Claire is fantastic at her job: calm, expert, compassionate. She cares deeply about her work, which, as the movie opens, takes place at a birthing clinic that will soon be closing. She cares so deeply, for instance, that she keeps trying to resuscitate a stillborn baby, long after everyone else has faced reality, in one of the movie’s many realistic medical scenes. (This one, in particular, was sufficiently convincing to arouse my terrified curiosity as to how it was achieved. The other childbirth scenes, and there are a fair number, also look authentic.)
Claire’s job appears to be the main focus of a tidy, organized, somewhat lonely life. A single mother, she has a son with whom she shares a tight bond, but he’s approaching adulthood and getting ready to strike out on his own. On weekends, and after biking home from the clinic, she tends a garden in a shared plot of land. Her neighbor there, a friendly, salt-of-the-earth truck driver named Paul — played with simple amiability by Olivier Gourmet, the wonderful actor and good-luck charm for the Belgian filmmaker brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne — takes an immediate strong liking to Claire. But she’s not terribly interested in making any human connections beyond those she has with the mothers she helps, and the babies she delivers.
But then a voice from the past sends a tremor into her placid life. That would be Ms. Deneuve’s Béatrice, a former mistress of Claire’s father (now dead), whose abandonment of both her lover and his daughter engendered heartbreak and worse 30 or so years earlier.
Still trying to keep up appearances, despite being in a bad place, Béatrice reaches out to Claire for the standard-issue movie melodrama reason: She’s gravely ill (with a brain tumor) and is afraid of dying alone. Yet she won’t alter her behavior, which includes a lot of smoking and drinking, some hard-core gambling and extravagant dining. Claire gives Béatrice advice, refuses her proffered gifts and tries brushing her off, but of course she cannot. The tremor becomes something of a genuine seismic event for Claire.
Because it is a French film, or rather the kind of French film that wants to serve its sentimentality with a dollop of prestige, “The Midwife” doesn’t offer an entirely shameless version of the “dying free spirit imbues uptight caretaker with a new lust for life” scenario. It doesn’t spoon-feed the viewer a lot of exposition, leaving parts of the back story a little enigmatic. It drops in peculiar little character touches, including one bizarre bit concerning the resemblance between Claire’s son, Simon, and his dear departed grandfather.
But it ends up where all of these movies do: spiritually (if you can call it that). Here the corporeal manifestation of the spiritual conclusion is three characters of a certain age in the cab of a moving 18-wheeler, smiling and singing along to Serge Reggiani. If there’s an American remake of this, the singer will be Jim Croce." 0.919849556 "Drama" "Unrated" "Music Box Films" "" "$21,341 " "$603,582 " "" "61" "7-Oct-11" "20-Oct-11" "14" 2

Paired with an aloof Kate Winslet — with whom he has less chemistry than he did with Wood Harris, who played his business partner on “The Wire” — he works very hard to appear oblivious to the script’s many idiocies. He does not succeed.
A disaster movie by any definition, this sappy adaptation of Charles Martin’s 2010 novel places Ben (Mr. Elba), a melancholy neurosurgeon, on a charter plane to Denver with Alex (Ms. Winslet), a supremely irritating photojournalist. Having joined forces when their commercial flight from Idaho was grounded by a storm, the two are further dismayed when their folksy pilot (Beau Bridges) suffers a stroke and smashes them into a snowy peak. Now they have to rescue not just themselves, but the pilot’s golden Labrador — which has no name and, apparently, no appetite.
Caught between the harsh demands of a survival story and the emotional beats of a romantic drama, the director, Hany Abu-Assad, grabs hold of neither. As the pair traipse to safety, artifice rules: A cougar is dispatched with shameless ease; an abandoned cabin manifests just in time to save a life and — almost three weeks into their ordeal — allow the couple to enjoy what is almost certainly malodorous sex.

If I followed that rule, I’d be unemployed. But still. There’s no great joy in accentuating the negative. So I will say this in favor of “The Mummy”: It is 110 minutes long. That is about 20 minutes shorter than “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,” about which I had some unkind things to say a couple of weeks ago. Simple math will tell you how much better this movie is than that one. If you have no choice but to see it — a circumstance I have trouble imagining — you can start in on your drinking that much sooner.
“The Mummy” begins with a supposed Egyptian proverb to the effect that “we” never really die; “we” assume new forms and keep right on living. I’m not an Egyptologist, but it seems just as likely that those words were lifted from a movie-studio strategy memo. Universal, lacking a mighty superhero franchise, has gone into its intellectual-property files, which are full of venerable monsters, and created a commercial agglomeration it calls the Dark Universe. “The Mummy” is the first of a slew — a swarm? a pestilence? — of features reviving those old creatures, including the one from the Black Lagoon. We can also look forward to new visits from Frankenstein’s monster and his bride, the Wolf Man and the Invisible Man, among others.
It sounds like fun. The “Mummy” reboot from 1999, directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, was kind of fun. Monster movies frequently are. This one, directed by Alex Kurtzman and starring Tom Cruise, is an unholy mess. Mr. Cruise plays Nick Morton, a jaunty military daredevil with a sideline in antiquities theft and a nutty sidekick (Jake Johnson). When a caper goes wrong, the two call in an airstrike on an Iraqi village — I guess that’s something people are doing for kicks nowadays — and a mysterious tomb is unearthed. Luckily, an archaeologist, Dr. Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), is on hand to explain what it’s all about and also to affirm Nick’s heterosexuality.
Long story short: An ancient evil has been unleashed upon the world. Its agent is a long-buried pharaoh’s daughter, Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), who is covered with mysterious tattoos and convinced that Nick is her secret lover, or the god of death, or both. She gets inside his head, which is awkward both because he’s kind of sweet on Jenny and because it’s such an empty place. Ahmanet also has a retinue of zombielike minions at her disposal, who rampage through England on their way to a meeting with Russell Crowe.
Mr. Crowe plays another fixture in the Dark Universe, a label that strikes me as a bit of an exaggeration. Dim Universe would be more accurate, with respect both to the murky, ugly images and to the intellectual capacities of the script, written and conceived by a bunch of people who are capable of better. The old black-and-white Universal horror movies were a mixed bag, but they had some imagination. They could be creepy or campy, weird or lyrical. “The Mummy” gestures — or flails — in a number of directions but settles into the dreary 21st-century action-blockbuster template. There’s chasing and fighting, punctuated by bouts of breathless explaining and a few one-liners that an archaeologist of the future might tentatively decode as jokes.
There is a vague notion that Nick is struggling with dueling impulses toward good and evil, acting out his version of the Jekyll-Hyde predicament. A more interesting movie might have involved a similar struggle within Ahmanet, but a more interesting movie was not on anybody’s mind.
It will be argued that this one was made not for the critics but for the fans. Which is no doubt true. Every con game is played with suckers in mind." 0.447652099 "Action" "PG-13" "Universal" "$80,000,000 " "$43,369,635 " "$155,385,488 " "" "1,414" "30-Sep-88" "" "" NA

Cody Wilson, a self-described techno-anarchist, found himself in trouble with the American government after publishing designs online that could be used to create a gun with a 3-D printer. Stopping him raises thorny questions involving the First and Second Amendments, and introduces broad arguments over liberty and innovation.
Interviews with Mr. Wilson show him to be both astute and confounding, sometimes sounding like a cautious bookworm, other times like an undergrad drunk on Ayn Rand novels; he disdains corporate influence in politics, yet admires the alt-right movement.
Mr. Wilson’s interests don’t end with guns. He has since joined with Amir Taaki, an anarchist from England, to create Dark Wallet, an internet application that allows for clandestine financial transactions using bitcoin. Like Mr. Wilson, Mr. Taaki has brazen ideas about revolution.
Those ideas have been around for centuries. But technologies can now turn them into something frightening. Though it would have been valuable to see Mr. Wilson and Mr. Taaki challenged on their opinions, Adam Bhala Lough, the director, allows the men to make uncontested cases for their extremist and sometimes militant stances. Interviews with Julian Assange and mentions of George Orwell are sprinkled throughout, sowing a sense of paranoia.

As W. F., an alcoholic author with a mysterious connection to the movie’s nebbishy hero, Thomas (Callum Turner), Mr. Bridges slips delightedly into the kind of arrogant-artist role he perfected in “The Door in the Floor” (2004). Here, his character is more grimy and less lustful, but no less certain of his own rectitude.
Washing up in Thomas’s Lower East Side apartment building, W. F. quickly becomes the young man’s literary life coach.

Burdened by thuddingly obvious musical choices (including Simon & Garfunkel’s gorgeous title song and, for crying out loud, Dylan’s “Visions of Johanna”), Allan Loeb’s script is glib and grating. The way is cleared for W. F., with his aura of slovenly glamour and precise knowledge of the cooking temperature of heroin, to steal the show.

It’s 1914, and the mission is in Van, part of the Ottoman Empire (now eastern Turkey), a place where complex political, religious and ethnic tensions are coming to a boil at the dawn of World War I.
The doctor whose plea caught Lillie’s attention, Jude (Josh Hartnett), is surprised when she shows up at the mission, but not only welcomes her, he also quickly develops a romantic interest in her.

“The Penguin Counters” follows a group of field biologists who travel to the frigid far South to estimate the animals’ numbers and to gauge the damage that climate change is causing them. The researchers are led by Ron Naveen, a scientist who has made trips to the area for decades.
“Penguins are my passion!” Mr. Naveen says. “Do I live for this? Yeah, absolutely! It’s what I live and breathe and think and do all the time.” He’s contagiously cheery, and most of his sentences seem to end with an exclamation point or a sense of wonder.

It can happen all too easily. An otherwise highly competent director (in this case, Terry George) succumbs to the lure of addressing a real-life atrocity (here, the still-contested slaughter of more than a million peaceful Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War I). Somewhere along the way, though, the need to do justice to the slain and call out the perpetrators becomes a pillow that smothers every spark of originality. Even actors with the heft of Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale — playing an Armenian apothecary named Mikael and an American war reporter named Chris — appear muffled and indistinct.
This dimming extends to an excruciatingly corny plot that has both characters vie for the twinkling affections of Ana (Charlotte Le Bon), a Paris-educated, terminally cute tutor. But first Mikael must finagle a dowry to finance medical school in Constantinople, so he promises to marry Maral (Angela Sarafyan), a lovely innocent from his village. Once in the grip of the city and Ana’s charms, however, Mikael is lost; the combined demands of a soggy love triangle and the approach of war soon banish all thoughts of marriage — to Maral, at least.
Mikael, then, is not particularly sympathetic, and Chris is a humorless newshound; so when the jackboots tramp and the killing begins, their fates are of less concern than they should be. And while Mikael endures the horrors of an Ottoman work camp, and Chris and Ana are busily saving orphans at a Protestant mission, their director — who was infinitely more adept with his other genocide movie, “Hotel Rwanda” — appears oblivious to the story’s inadequacies. Aspiring to the sweep of epics like “Doctor Zhivago” and “Reds,” Mr. George achieves neither the romantic delirium of the first nor the sheer swaggering gumption of the second.
Money does not seem to have been the problem: The film reportedly cost almost $100 million, and some of it is even on the screen.

In 2002, the Canadian-Armenian director Atom Egoyan took a more modest yet ultimately more potent path to the genocide with his underseen “Ararat.” Though not entirely successful, that film — which directly addressed the cinematic challenge of representing history — profited from sharply perceptive writing and a studious avoidance of melodrama.

Somewhere along the way, though, the need to do justice to the slain and call out the perpetrators becomes a pillow that smothers every spark of originality. Even actors with the heft of Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale — playing an Armenian apothecary named Mikael and an American war reporter named Chris — appear muffled and indistinct.
This dimming extends to an excruciatingly corny plot that has both characters vie for the twinkling affections of Ana (Charlotte Le Bon), a Paris-educated, terminally cute tutor. But first Mikael must finagle a dowry to finance medical school in Constantinople, so he promises to marry Maral (Angela Sarafyan), a lovely innocent from his village. Once in the grip of the city and Ana’s charms, however, Mikael is lost; the combined demands of a soggy love triangle and the approach of war soon banish all thoughts of marriage — to Maral, at least.
Mikael, then, is not particularly sympathetic, and Chris is a humorless newshound; so when the jackboots tramp and the killing begins, their fates are of less concern than they should be. And while Mikael endures the horrors of an Ottoman work camp, and Chris and Ana are busily saving orphans at a Protestant mission, their director — who was infinitely more adept with his other genocide movie, “Hotel Rwanda” — appears oblivious to the story’s inadequacies. Aspiring to the sweep of epics like “Doctor Zhivago” and “Reds,” Mr. George achieves neither the romantic delirium of the first nor the sheer swaggering gumption of the second.
Money does not seem to have been the problem: The film reportedly cost almost $100 million, and some of it is even on the screen. Yet we never forget for one second that we’re watching actors in fancy dress; behind the curtain of cattle cars and starving workers, above the noise of the explosions, we can hear the moviemaking machinery clank and whir.
In 2002, the Canadian-Armenian director Atom Egoyan took a more modest yet ultimately more potent path to the genocide with his underseen “Ararat.” Though not entirely successful, that film — which directly addressed the cinematic challenge of representing history — profited from sharply perceptive writing and a studious avoidance of melodrama.

But adding movies to the list might only raise questions. Who would judge? Should fiction and documentary receive separate awards?
An excellent example of what not to award, however, comes from “The Pulitzer at 100,” an hour and a half of congratulatory platitudes timed to the prizes’ centennial. Although produced independently, this documentary, directed by Kirk Simon, plays as if the Pulitzers were presenting an award to themselves.
Past winners, including Wynton Marsalis, Paula Vogel, Tracy K. Smith and Tony Kushner, share insights on their writing processes and how the recognition has affected their careers. Celebrities like Natalie Portman and Martin Scorsese read from winning works, with which they are sometimes oddly paired.
The best anecdotes aren’t simple victory laps. Nicholas D. Kristof, a New York Times columnist, who received the award for his reporting on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement and his columns about the genocide in Darfur, notes “a certain irony in gaining from a surge in human misery.” Carol D. Leonnig of The Washington Post recounts her prizewinning coverage of Secret Service lapses. John Filo and Nick Ut explain how they photographed famous images of the Vietnam era. Reporters from The Times-Picayune recall Hurricane Katrina.
Yet couching these achievements in a testament to Joseph Pulitzer’s enduring genius seems trivializing.

It all seems so long ago, and yet it also feels as if it were happening right now. The television journalists with their trench coats and stentorian inflections. The president on horseback. “Evil Empire.” “Trust, but verify.” “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!”
But for viewers seeking either to refresh their memories of, or to learn something new about, the 40th president, this documentary, directed by Sierra Pettengill and Pacho Velez and made up of ’80s-vintage archival video, will prove puzzling and unsatisfying. It dwells, as people often did back then, on the remarkable fact that Reagan had been an actor in Hollywood, but it does not chronicle the path that took him from the movies to the California governor’s mansion on his way to the White House.
Nor does it deal with his campaigns, or with his role in the ideological transformation of American politics. Domestic policy is all but invisible. There is nothing about tax cuts, supply-side economics, the air traffic controllers’ strike, AIDS or the Supreme Court. No Grenada, no El Salvador, no Lebanon. The Iran-contra scandal gets a bit of attention, but only as a sidebar to the film’s main preoccupation, the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.
That is a great and consequential story, of course, and focusing on it saves “The Reagan Show” from triviality. The improbable diplomatic bromance between Reagan, an unbending anti-Communist, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the reform-minded general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, yielded many memorable moments on the public stage. Their negotiation of an arms treaty also provides a rare and encouraging example of successful peacemaking between rival countries. While thin on strategic or historical analysis, the film does provide a glimpse at the characters of the two leaders.
Reagan himself, though, remains something of a cipher. What you see in these videos, many of them recorded as part of a novel administration initiative called “White House TV,” is mostly what you might remember or expect. The president seems like an affable, charming man, at once comfortable in his own skin and oddly detached from his surroundings, with a ready supply of quips, quotations and anecdotes to defuse whatever tension or discomfort might be hovering in the air. If you were predisposed to hate him, you might be surprised to feel a twinge of affection. If you already admired him, you may want a more robust hagiography.
But, in any case, you will have to go elsewhere to assess the consequences of his style of leadership, and of the movement he helped bring to power. There are many fine books, of course, and a brilliant essay by Joan Didion. The rhetorical questions posed by earnest talking heads of the era have been rendered moot by history, but Reagan’s legacy remains a live and contentious issue. His name is still routinely invoked, on the left and the right, with reverence and rage. “The Reagan Show” helps attach a face to the name, but it doesn’t accomplish much more than that." 0.911320944 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Gravitas Ventures" "" "$6,067 " "$26,875 " "$66,400,000 " "2,971" "7-Nov-97" "" "" NA

Recent Hollywood movies like “Moana” and “Finding Dory” display glistening waves, plump raindrops and churning ocean depths with gaudy trade-show flash. “The Red Turtle,” a feature by the Dutch animator Michael Dudok de Wit, hews to a quieter, proudly analog (or at least analog-evoking) approach. The waves that toss the nameless protagonist, a presumably shipwrecked fellow with black-dot eyes and an inky beard, are proudly two-dimensional, and look as if they had been rendered with a pen and a brush rather than a mouse and a software application.
The film, a French-Belgian-Japanese co-production made under the auspices of Studio Ghibli  (home of the great Hayao Miyazaki) in Tokyo is also notable, at least in contrast to most American commercial animation, for the absence of celebrity voices or, indeed, of any human speech at all. The score, by Laurent Perez del Mar, does include some wordless choral vocalizing, but the story, like the visual style, is simple and elemental, like a picture book that needs no words.
The story has a wide-eyed, mutedly whimsical charm, with a light washing of eco-mysticism. Some of what happens may, on reflection, seem a little disturbing. The hapless mariner washes ashore — as such sailors usually do — on a deserted island, a tropical, rock-capped outcropping with wide, sandy beaches flanking a dense bamboo forest. There is a freshwater lagoon, and a few animals around for company and food, including sea lions and a squadron of quizzical crabs that silently and collectively perform the necessary cute-cartoon-sidekick duties.
The red sea turtle, an enigmatic and beautifully drawn creature that seems to have some kind of grudge against our hero, shows up just when you start to wonder if it will. Every time the man tries to leave the island, the turtle smashes his raft and knocks him back over the sandbar onto the beach. This leads to a confrontation that nudges the story all the way into the realm of fable. I won’t say exactly what happens, except to note that it’s both enchanting and a little queasy-making. But new characters do appear, fleshing out the drama and the imagery. Events take place that allow Mr. Dudok de Wit to make the most of his subdued palette and his spare, lyrical draftsmanship.
“The Red Turtle” practices a minor, gentle magic. It wants you to smile and say, “Ahh,” rather than gasp and say, “Wow.” But somehow the understatement can feel a bit overdone, as if the film were hovering over you, awaiting an expression of admiration. And it is hard not to admire the earnest artistry on display, even though it may also be hard to be as moved or enraptured as you suspect you should." 0.988377278 "Animation" "PG" "Sony Classics" "" "$21,010 " "$921,974 " "" "1" "26-Mar-04" "" "98" 14

There are cracks in the walls, and the high-rise building is in danger of collapsing. That flawed edifice might stand as a kind of inverse metaphor for the film itself, which is a marvel of meticulous construction. With exquisite patience and attention to detail, Asghar Farhadi, the writer and director, builds a solid and suspenseful plot out of ordinary incidents, and packs it with rich and resonant ideas.
Admirers of his earlier films — including “About Elly,” “The Past” and “A Separation,” a foreign-language Oscar winner in 2012 — will not be surprised. Mr. Farhadi has distinguished himself in his generation of Iranian filmmakers as an astute psychological realist and a fastidious storyteller. Although his films take place in a thoroughly modern, urban environment, there is something satisfyingly old-fashioned about his approach to contemporary life, an understated belief in the ethical value of addressing the complexities of experience through the clarity and subtlety of narrative art.
[See where to stream Asghar Farhadi’s dramas at Watching, The New York Times’s film and TV recommendation site.]
Rana and Emad, a childless married couple who look to be in their mid-30s, are both actors, members of a theater company engaged in a production of Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman.” Onstage, they play the Lomans, Willy and Linda, whose lower-middle-class American world is made to look both familiar and exotic. Some of the play’s sexual frankness has been blunted by Iranian government censors — in a pivotal scene, Willy’s mistress shows up in his hotel room wearing a hat and a belted red raincoat, rather than a nightgown — and its themes of striving and sacrifice seem distant from Rana and Emad’s life. Though they are not wealthy, the fact that they “work in culture” gives them a certain cachet, and they sometimes radiate a quiet sense of superiority in interactions with neighbors and acquaintances.
The ghost of Willy Loman nonetheless hovers over “The Salesman,” suggesting an interpretive puzzle. The choice of this particular play-within-the-film can’t be arbitrary, but its meaning is not immediately apparent. For most of its running time, the movie seems occupied with its own dramatic issues, principally the aftermath of a shocking and apparently inexplicable act of violence.
The apartment that Emad and Rana move into — thanks to the generosity of a colleague — isn’t actually haunted, but like many films about real estate “The Salesman” is to some extent a horror movie. The previous tenant was a single woman with a young child, and the stuff she left behind is more than just annoying clutter. It’s a collection of clues to an unacknowledged mystery, haunting traces of an invisible life.
That life invades the couple’s household with shocking force. Rana is assaulted in the shower, and her attacker vanishes, leaving behind his pickup truck. The crime reveals tensions and fissures within her marriage, and also beyond it. Rana, whose head was injured in the attack — other possible traumas are left implicit — is terrified and distraught, but Emad seems more concerned with the injury to his own manhood. The absence of the police suggests a lack of trust in official authority so complete that it is scarcely worth mentioning. Emad’s search for answers, and for something like justice, turns him into a reluctant vigilante, and “The Salesman” is unsparing in its portrayal of the moral emptiness of personal vengeance.
It is in the midst of this painful tale of crime and punishment that the spirit of Willy Loman makes its improbable, powerful and surprisingly literal return. “The Salesman” is about trust and honor, about violence against women in a patriarchal society, about the woe that is in marriage, but it is also about death, a salesman and the hidden brutality of class. Not since Pedro Almodóvar’s “All About My Mother,” which brilliantly re-engineered “A Streetcar Named Desire,” has a classic of the American stage been put to such ingenious cinematic use. Mr. Farhadi’s control is astonishing, as is the discipline of the actors. Their final scenes are at once riveting and hard to watch.

The book, a first-person account of its aged protagonist, Tony Webster, has a bifurcated structure: “how I remembered these events” and “what really happened.” Flashbacks arrive in blink-and-you-miss-them bursts that then expand to explain the significance of a look or a gesture; memory becomes a form of time travel, putting Tony (Jim Broadbent) inside his own recollections, taking the place of his young self.
An unexpected legacy touches off reminders of his student days, his first love, his most significant friendship. All of these seem far away from the life he has come to live, as a tidy, proper and emotionally detached camera shop owner, mostly in the company of his ex-wife (Harriet Walter) and daughter (Michelle Dockery). We suspect there are sad reasons for this; we soon learn they are worse than sad, and Tony will have to face his part in them.
Freya Mavor and Charlotte Rampling are hauntingly enigmatic and ravishing as his former love, young and old, and Joe Alwyn as the ex-friend is charismatically cerebral. Directed by Ritesh Batra from a screenplay by Nick Payne, the film maintains intrigue and emotional magnetism as its mystery unfolds. Unfortunately, it goes wobbly in the last quarter, as Tony’s refusal to face up to his past actions begins to look less willful and more stupid.

That said, a bit more editing to remove some of the airiness would have made for a better film.
The movie, based on William P. Young’s best seller and directed by Stuart Hazeldine, is about the spiritual journey of Mack (Sam Worthington), whose youngest child is abducted and murdered while he is watching over her and her two siblings on a camping trip.
Mack wallows in grief and survivor’s guilt, as well as anger, much of which is directed at God. Then a mysterious note from Papa — his wife’s pet name for the Almighty — invites him to revisit the remote shack where the police believe his child was killed. There he meets the divine trinity of some Christian faiths: Papa (Octavia Spencer), his son (Avraham Aviv Alush) and the Holy Spirit (Sumire).
Many faith-based films settle for a Jesus-loves-me climax without digging far into theological matters. This one at least asks the difficult questions. It’s at its best when Mack is grilling Papa on matters like why she allows children to be murdered.
“Stop talking in riddles,” he admonishes her after yet another vague answer.
She never really does. Not to be sacrilegious, but as a film character, Papa doesn’t have a lot of depth; for much of the movie it’s as if Mack has stumbled into a very nice bed-and-breakfast and God is the universe’s most benevolent innkeeper.
And so as the film passes the two-hour mark, it begins to feel as if it’s treading water. People of faith already know that there are no cut-and-dried answers to the kinds of questions Mack is asking.

It tells the story of Ishmael Muslim Ali, who in 1973, when he was called Ishmael LaBeet, was convicted along with four other men of murdering eight people in a shooting at the Fountain Valley Golf Course in St. Croix, V.I., in 1972. Whether the crime was a botched robbery or an episode of racially motivated violence is the subject of debate. (Seven of the eight victims were white and all five suspects were black.)
Incredibly, that’s only the beginning of Mr. Ali’s story: On New Year’s Eve in 1984, as he was being transferred from a court in the Virgin Islands back to prison on an American Airlines flight, he hijacked the plane and redirected it to Cuba, where he has lived ever since. (It is not clear how long he will remain, given the changing United States relationship with Havana.)
The film, directed by Jamie Kastner, comes billed as having the first interview Mr. Ali has given since that escape. He turns out to be a charismatic and contradictory camera subject. He recounts his experiences in Vietnam, from which he received a dishonorable discharge, and his involvement with the Black Panthers. While admitting he’s no angel, he says he was railroaded in the Fountain Valley case. (Mr. Kastner offers some support for the defense’s argument that the convicts’ confessions resulted from torture.)
Notwithstanding Mr. Ali’s account, the most surreal interviews come from the passengers and crew of the flight, who today seem oddly admiring of their hijacker. “The Skyjacker’s Tale” could stand to lose its gimmicky re-enactments.

This ostensible whodunit involves a serial killer who’s preying on women, leaving behind carefully arranged body parts and a childlike snowman as a kind of elaborate signature. The greater puzzle, though, is how an enterprise studded with so much talent — starting with the director Tomas Alfredson (“Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy”) and including the star Michael Fassbender — has led to such a grim, thrill-free thriller, one without a twitch of real feeling and next to no elementary story sense.
Mr. Fassbender plays Harry Hole, a dissipated, alcoholic detective living in Oslo, which presumably means he’s Norwegian even if he (and most everyone else) speaks in English. With his red-rimmed eyes and a cigarette drooping from his lips, Harry comes across as one of those classically shabby gumshoe types, the existential inside-outsider who chafes against the rules even as he saves the day. He has an ex (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and a new colleague (Rebecca Ferguson), and soon he has a mess of trouble that he navigates amid a great deal of snow, byzantine developments, dead-end detours and a grab bag of random characters. (Val Kilmer, Chloë Sevigny and Toby Jones all breeze by.)
The problem isn’t the narrative complications, even if the movie soon becomes mired in them. Raymond Chandler tied his novel “The Big Sleep” into so many knots that apparently he couldn’t tell who killed one of its characters. As Leigh Brackett, who helped turn the novel into the 1946 film, said, “When you read it from page to page it moves so beautifully that you don’t care.” The problem, Brackett said, was “if you start tearing it apart to see what makes it tick, it comes unglued.” The trick was to hold on to Chandler’s language and go with his flow, mood and milieu, letting — as the film’s director, Howard Hawks, said later — the characters “handle the plot, rather than let the plot move them.”
Certainly “The Snowman” might have been better if someone at some point had learned from Hawks (always a good idea) and let the characters handle the plot. That might have helped, at least a little. The movie is based on a novel by the popular Norwegian writer Jo Nesbo, whose intricately involved, atmospheric tales are far more complex — they have politics, themes and worldviews — than anything in this movie. Shot to shot, Mr. Alfredson and his estimable team give you plenty to look at, including acres of blinding white snow, noirish nights, desaturated pooling red, a sleekly generic Euro-scape and Mr. Fassbender’s expressionless mug. Yet there’s no glue — not a whiff of life or a single substantial, grounding directorial idea — that makes this pottage work scene to scene." 0.721930494 "Crime" "R" "Universal" "$35,000,000 " "$3,372,565 " "$6,700,035 " "" "44" "5-May-89" "5-Oct-89" "" NA

If his unadorned high-art allusions can make him an acquired taste, his latest farce, “The Son of Joseph,” is his most accessible film since “The Living World,” from 2003.
Divided into five sections, each named after a biblical episode, “The Son of Joseph” is a fanciful repackaging of the Nativity (the media notes, perhaps seizing on Hollywood’s zest for recycling, call it a “reboot”): A sullen teenager, Vincent (Victor Ezenfis), raised by a nurse (Natacha Régnier), learns his father is a vain publisher, Oscar (Mathieu Amalric), who can’t even keep track of how many children he has.
Stalking Oscar at his hotel office (Mr. Green appears as the concierge), Vincent meets Joseph (Fabrizio Rongione), Oscar’s kind, disinherited brother. Joseph accompanies Vincent to the Louvre and teaches him about art and life. He may even be a match for Vincent’s mother. (Her name, it turns out, is Marie.)
Mr. Green’s taste for frontal compositions and clipped editing sometimes recalls the filmmaker Robert Bresson, although Bresson wasn’t known for his throwaway humor. (Probably not many teenagers’ bedrooms include replicas of Caravaggio’s “The Sacrifice of Isaac,” and Maria de Medeiros has a funny role as a perpetually confused literary critic.)

Set in the near future, it plays like a transmission from 1986, when a boy and a spaceship’s robot pilot could raise hell in “Flight of the Navigator,” and Steven Spielberg set the blockbuster template to emulate.
On a mission to colonize Mars, the lead astronaut (Janet Montgomery) learns she is pregnant. This news upsets Nathaniel Shepherd, the wild-haired mogul responsible for the venture, who fears the consequences of subjecting a fetus to zero gravity. He is played by Gary Oldman, clearly way too enthusiastic about this gig.
The existence of the child, Gardner (Asa Butterfield), is classified, and he grows up on Mars. Gardner mourns the fact that few know he exists and ruefully watches the copy of “Wings of Desire” a German scientist left behind. This sullen teenager has (naturally) a robot friend and (somehow) a video-chat pal on Earth. Because the screenwriter is Allan Loeb (“Collateral Beauty”), she is called Tulsa (Britt Robertson).
Their inevitable meeting — something about using carbon nanotubes to strengthen Gardner’s bone density is muttered — occasions an Earth road trip. Gardner must learn about human customs, convince his girlfriend that he’s not a weirdo and find his father before his space-addled heart gives out.

"307" "The Sunshine Makers" "1/13/2017" "1/19/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/movies/the-sunshine-makers-review.html" 0 "The title of the documentary “The Sunshine Makers” — about two trippy American renegades who produced millions of hits of LSD and helped turn on the United States of Acid — sounds like one of those old citrus labels that growers used to slap on wooden crates. With names like Morning Glory, these crates promised a ray of sun in each juicy bite. In 1970, Florida anointed itself the Sunshine State, but this documentary suggests that way out West, where much of this acid was produced, was where the sun shone the brightest.
For Nick Sand and Tim Scully, lysergic acid diethylamide was where it, really everything, was at. Both were in their 20s when they first experimented with psychedelics, an experience they say in the movie indelibly changed each for good and, some might say, bad. A California native, Mr. Scully had been studying at Berkeley before coming under the influence of Owsley Stanley, an intimate of the Grateful Dead and fervent advocate for acid. The more voluble Mr. Sand, a Brooklynite, entered the scene through Millbrook — the estate in upstate New York where Timothy Leary and friends partied for years — eventually going west. (In the early 1960s, Leary helped oversee the Harvard Psilocybin Project, researching LSD.)
Whether together or apart, Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully seemed to be operating on a similar wavelength, and the movie gets a lot of mileage from their sometimes excellent, at times hair-raising, occasionally puckishly funny and altogether wild adventures. At least according to “The Sunshine Makers,” theirs is the story of two young men who found and (arguably) lost their way in the ’60s, a tale that has resonance for the bigger sociopolitical picture. Both Mr. Scully and Mr. Sand saw themselves as missionaries of a type, spreading transcendence one hit at a time. Mr. Sand says that during one early enlightened moment, a voice told him, “Your job on this planet is to make psychedelics and turn on the world.” He obeyed that voice unconditionally.
The director, Cosmo Feilding Mellen, fluidly knits together a lot of information, people and places, sights and sounds, including some faded, pretty far-out archival footage of Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully making acid in labs back in the day. (The editor Nick Packer deserves credit as well.) As Mr. Mellen plaits together these individual histories, he incessantly toggles between past and present. Some of the flashbacks to the ’60s are as familiar as hippie chicks and the corner of Haight and Ashbury, but Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully are true individuals, with delightful quirks and weird tales that keep the material from genericism. (There are several scenes of Mr. Sand practicing yoga in the nude, a lifelong habit that he’s continued into his 70s.)
“The Sunshine Makers” isn’t exactly an advocacy movie, but Mr. Mellen’s sympathies are transparently with his subjects, even if he does check in (humorously and a touch condescendingly) with some of the cops who once chased down Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully.

"308" "The Teacher" "8/30/2017" "8/29/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/movies/the-teacher-review-jan-hrebejk.html" 0 "“The Teacher” is a foray into Slovak-language filmmaking by the industrious Czech director Jan Hrebejk, and for the occasion, he and his regular screenwriter, Petr Jarchovsky, have chosen a premise that sets up a dark satire about governance and human nature.
Set in Bratislava in 1983, when Czechoslovakia was under Communist rule, the movie centers on a new teacher, Maria Drazdechova (Zuzana Maurery), who, upon meeting her students, asks for their parents’ lines of work.
Using the children’s grades as leverage, Maria plans to blackmail the parents into favors. These range from the menial (fixing her washing machine) to the potentially ruinous (smuggling a cake to Moscow by plane, which could cost a father who works at the airport his job). Ms. Maurery has great fun with the character, a tricky part because Maria nearly always maintains a kindhearted veneer, even at her most venal. It’s clear she has no regard for her class’s well-being or education.
While somewhat on the nose as allegory, the movie deftly illustrates that a culture of collaboration — whether in Bratislava in the 1980s or, indeed, any political or workplace context — requires active participation, even if subconscious. When Maria backs down on the cake-smuggling request, Marek (Csongor Kassai), the airport accountant, is so relieved that he offers to drive her to her country cottage, seemingly oblivious that he’s being pressed into a different kind of service.
Most of what we see of Maria comes in flashbacks during a parents’ conference the school’s head teacher (Ina Gogalova) has convened, risking her own job because Maria is the chair of the Communist Party at the school. But if enough parents sign a formal complaint, they may be able to oust her.
There are shades of “12 Angry Men” in the scenes of the parents trying to convince one another to sign it. Contrary to the idea that strength comes in numbers, “The Teacher” illustrates that some of the parents, while individually upset, are afraid to speak up as a group. They’ve already bought into a corrupt system, acceding to the teacher’s demands, and signing the petition is tantamount to an admission of guilt.
Like Mr. Hrebejk’s “Divided We Fall” — a story of a sheepish Czech gentile who locates a vein of courage and generosity during the Nazi occupation — “The Teacher” is polished, engaging and somewhat risk-averse. True, there’s nothing lighthearted about the plot, which finds one student driven toward suicide and an astrophysicist father (Peter Bebjak), whose wife has left him, reduced to washing windows.
But “The Teacher” doesn’t dare take its premise to darker places by having Maria prod the parents too far beyond the bounds of their own moral compasses — a logical conclusion of this story. As the psychologist Stanley Milgram’s experiments on obedience showed — and some governments have learned — a flock in thrall to an authority figure may follow that person anywhere." 0.988001495 "Comedy" "Unrated" "Film Movement" "" "" "$32,645 " "$8,001,380 " "39" "15-Mar-13" "11-Apr-13" "28" 4

Instead, this unquestionably adult drama about a blind man who can suddenly see unfolds with an emotional sophistication that far outstrips its narrative nerve.
For perhaps the first time, James (an exceptional Dan Stevens) is experiencing temptation. The shrinking of a pituitary tumor has restored the sight he lost as a teenager, and he’s less than happy with what he sees. On a quest to upgrade his home, his job (as a mortgage-refinancing drone), and his wife (the gorgeous Malin Akerman, here reverse-engineered to look homely), James becomes the epitome of soulless ambition.
“You don’t want to lose control,” he tells his wife when she balks at his newly unilateral decision-making. An image makeover and an affair with a sexy co-worker (Kerry Bishé) accompany his corporate ascent, but it’s his psychological torment that the director, Ido Fluk, is most eager to plumb, and he does so with captivating sensuousness.
For a while, this makes “The Ticket” a fascinating character study expressed through whispered conversations and flickering light and shade. Its emotions — like the jealousy of James’s blind best friend (Oliver Platt) — feel brutally honest, as does its understanding of the allure of being desired without being pitied.
Yet the script is incapable of penetrating the moral thicket that the actors and the cinematographer, Zachary Galler, have so carefully woven.

The year is 1979, the fashions are horrendous and Sami has but two ambitions: To win the love of his childhood sweetheart and achieve the social status of his father, a celebrated tiger hunter who died when Sami was a child. Problems arise immediately when an expected engineering position disappears in a downsizing company, leaving Sami with a temporary job as a draftsman and a visa that’s set to expire in 30 days.
With a likable cast and a wholesome message about the true meaning of success, “The Tiger Hunter” might balk at the harsher details of immigrant life, but it has a generosity of spirit that lifts everyone up. Surrounding Sami with a strong support group of fellow South Asian professionals working menial jobs, the director, Lena Khan (who wrote the script with Sameer Gardezi, and whose own grandfather was a tiger hunter), knows exactly the story she wants to tell.
She is helped immensely by Mr. Pudi, whose quirky performance as a television-obsessed student on the NBC comedy “Community” was a consistent delight. It also gave him an ease with ensemble work that allows him to blend with other actors instead of sucking attention. The result is an endearingly old-fashioned comedy, not just in its style and the sweetness of its plot, but also in its bright-eyed optimism about immigrant opportunities.

That way, the therapeutic calm instilled by the glorious Iberian scenery (photographed by James Clarke in shimmering, almost edible pastels) could be savored uninterrupted by the performative patter of the two stars, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. I imagine that the diners seated near them in the restaurants where much of this movie takes place would have been grateful for mute buttons of their own.
Like “The Trip” in 2011 and “The Trip to Italy” three years later, this latest cushy assignment sends the lads — once again playing Steve and Rob, mildly fictionalized versions of themselves — tootling around a randomly chosen region, sampling menus and trading banter. I hesitate to say jokes, because, unlike the bounce and zing of the first movie, the tone here is more sober and the humor more strained. Barely squeaking by on a familiar formula and flimsy narrative (Steve is writing a book; Rob is scribbling restaurant reviews for The New York Times), the actors convey a sense of going through the motions. Eating sumptuous meals without apparent relish, jogging separately through impossibly gorgeous towns, and firing off celebrity impersonations with wearying one-upmanship, they perform with the competitive reflexivity of the longtime double act.
Yet even artists as gifted as these two can only hitchhike so long on the charisma of household names like Mick Jagger and Michael Caine, and the dueling impressions that fuel the franchise have become effortful and repetitive. (One extended bit on Roger Moore is tortured to the point of desperation.) And though the spaces between the funny voices are filled with verdant hillsides and vanilla beaches that stretch the length of the frame, there’s an occasional sour edge to the comedic sparring.
This comes almost entirely from Steve, whose midlife anxieties — including an elusive, married lover and a neglectful agent — are the burr under the movie’s saddle. Plagued by disturbing dreams and career frustrations, he becomes increasingly distracted and crabby, until every comic utterance feels like a shot across the bow of mortality. This poignancy makes the picture less humorous but potentially more substantive than its predecessors. And as the men imagine themselves Don Quixote and Sancho Panza (daftly abetted by Noel Harrison’s 1960s hit “The Windmills of Your Mind”), the film’s failure to engage with these discomforts feels like a missed opportunity.
Instead, Mr. Winterbottom and his team — by means of an extremely strange ending — appear to be setting us up for a Trip to Morocco. Sorry, guys, but that one’s already been done." 0.027496709 "Comedy" "Not Yet Rated" "IFC" "" "$40,875 " "$1,157,604 " "" "1" "16-Dec-88" "" "" NA

By a logic at once elusive and meticulous, it is also, therefore, about the consequences of inaction. Moral indifference is an easy path, and it leads to other, graver sins, including cruelty and dishonesty. But the harder road of decency has its own traps and byways, as a young doctor named Jenny Davin discovers.
Jenny, played with somber concentration by Adèle Haenel, is devoted to her profession and her patients. She is thorough and compassionate, scolding her intern (Olivier Bonnaud) for failing to keep his emotions in check and communicating clearly and efficiently with the mostly poor people who come to her office. On the verge of moving into a more prestigious position, she decides, almost impulsively, to stay where she is, and take over her retired mentor’s small general practice. It’s what she loves, and she is loved in return.
But in the Dardennes’ moral universe the ways of love are never simple. Having established that Jenny is a good person, the film allows her what at first seems to be a trivial lapse. Late one evening, long after office hours have finished, the front buzzer sounds and Jenny decides to ignore it. (That buzzer and the functional ringtone on Jenny’s cellphone are the film’s principal sound effects and the closest thing it has to a musical score.) The next morning, a woman is found dead nearby, and security video identifies her as the person who had been at Jenny’s door.
Not much else is known about her, and Jenny, in a fit of self-reproach, tries to compensate for her neglect by finding out what she can. As they often have before — in “The Son,” “The Child” and “Lorna’s Silence,” most notably — the Dardennes use techniques of suspense to pursue an ethical problem. And vice versa. Jenny, stubborn in the face of her own fear and the threats and evasions of the people she encounters, is equal parts detective and priest. She uses the promise of doctor-patient confidentiality, a secular version of the seal of confession, to coax out shameful secrets. She also burrows into a demimonde of poverty, desperation and crime that exists just beyond her waiting room and sometimes spills into it.
“The Unknown Girl” is as tense as a police procedural, and as mysterious as a religious parable. It’s a Dardenne brothers film, in other words, shot with unassuming lyricism and an eye for everyday detail and full of modest, eloquent performances (including from Jérémie Renier, the star of “The Child.”) The brothers’ methods are austere, but not harsh. They are students of human cruelty and champions of the resistance to it. In their world — in our world, as their unforgettable films reveal it to us — there is no end of guilt, and just enough grace." 0.998148752 "Crime" "Unrated" "IFC" "" "$13,477 " "$150,549 " "" "7" "21-Sep-12" "1-Nov-12" "" NA

Its main characters, who live in the central Mexican city of Guanajuato, are young, gloomy, attractive men and women connected by friendship, family ties and sexual longing and divided by those same things. The movie, directed by Amat Escalante from a script he wrote with Gibrán Portela, might be a dour, observant study of modern relationships among the urban middle class were it not for the presence of a slimy, many-tentacled space creature living in a cabin in the countryside.
The thing ostensibly arrived on an asteroid, but its more salient provenance is a pornographic tradition, notably but not exclusively Japanese, that occasionally slithers into the cinematic mainstream. The alien, whose gender is indeterminate, is awesome in bed, though not always gentle. While its partners, male and female, experience inexpressible and addictive bliss in its company, some of them also suffer grievous and even fatal injuries.
The first one we meet is Verónica (Simone Bucio). While being treated for an alien-sex-related mishap she pretends is a dog bite, she befriends Fabián (Eden Villavicencio), a nurse. His sister, Alejandra (Ruth Ramos), is married to Ángel (Jesús Meza), a drunken macho sad sack who is having an affair with Fabián. Fabián, encouraged by Verónica, finds his way to the extraterrestrial love shack (which is tended by a sweet, hippie-ish older couple). But it’s Alejandra, neglected by Ángel and stressed out by their two young sons and Ángel’s domineering mother, who seems like the most likely victim. Or lover. Or whatever you call it.
Mr. Escalante’s previous film, “Heli,” was about a factory worker caught up in Mexico’s drug violence. It contains several horrific — and now notorious — scenes of brutality, but what makes those moments especially unnerving is the low-key domestic naturalism in which they are embedded. Mr. Escalante is an exceptionally deft and subtle realist, and you sometimes feel, in “Heli” and even more so in “The Untamed” that he is drawn to extremity partly out of boredom with his own skill. And so he turns a downbeat melodrama of unhappy marriage, bohemian drift and sexual duplicity into something bizarre and horrific.
There is another possibility, though, which is that “The Untamed” is not a slice-of-life tale pretending to be a monster movie, but rather a bone-dry comedy pretending to be both of those things. There is a fine line between horror and humor, and if you adjust your angle of vision accordingly, you can see the architecture of farce beneath the ornamentation of shock and suffering. The meticulous deadpan of the performances diverts attention from the absurdity of the circumstances. Fabián, Ángel and Alejandra are joined in a classic triangle, which Verónica and the alien throw into high relief even as they disrupt it.

With arms outstretched from the sides of the screen, and our eyes taking in the perspective of the killer, we shoot, hack and beat our way through a sea of assailants.
As directed by Jung Byung-gil, a former stuntman, the film mirrors the experience of playing a video game. The camera whips to each new target with the assurance of someone who knows all the combinations, and has instinctive, practiced access to every code and cheat. The only sign of conscious, unautomated humanity is the sound of the protagonist’s ragged breathing — an acknowledgment of the exhaustion that comes when a human being is pushed to become an action avatar.
Such is the plight of Sook-hee (Kim Ok-bin), a trained assassin who is the focus of this convoluted thriller. After executing the movie’s opening slaughter, she is caught by the police and recruited as a sleeper agent by an intelligence agency, which promises her freedom following 10 years of service. As “The Villainess” jumps between Sook-hee’s past and present, it becomes clear that she is trapped in a dizzying world of violence, where neither law nor outlaws can be trusted. Yet despite her despair, every action scene is as queasily pristine as the first, leaving “The Villainess” caught in paradox.

Working with an unusually small budget (this is no “Edge of Tomorrow”) and an uncomfortably tight shooting schedule (14 days in the California desert), Mr. Liman answers the siren song of minimalism with gusto if not complete success. In lieu of flying shrapnel and fancy production design, the director ramps the intensity to 11, then breaks the dial. Sweaty, square-jawed close-ups substitute for fighting, and fake blood is doled out by the thimbleful. Special effects are hoarded for maximum shock and awe.
For a while, this formula works as Sergeant Isaac (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) hunkers behind a crumbling wall in a godforsaken swath of Iraq, pinned down by an unseen enemy sniper. The year is 2007, and the war is winding down; but Isaac and his commanding officer, Staff Sgt. Matthews (the professional wrestler and entertainment hyphenate John Cena), were responding to a distress signal when the sniper struck. Matthews has already been severely wounded and lies unconscious on the other side of the wall. What to do?
If you’re the novice screenwriter Dwain Worrell, you introduce a gimmick: a sniper who really wants to talk. And as his voice on Isaac’s mobile phone reveals, he’s also educated, fond of Edgar Allan Poe, and knowledgeable about the movements of Isaac’s unit. To reveal more would be unfair, but suffice to say that, like the entombed civilian contractor played by Ryan Reynolds in Rodrigo Cortés’s “Buried,” Isaac knows that his escape might depend more on wits than weapons.
Also like “Buried,” “The Wall” is essentially a one-man show, and Mr. Taylor-Johnson can’t be faulted, somehow injecting energy and variety into his character’s largely immobile plight. He’s helped immensely by the director of photography, Roman Vasyanov (a favorite of the director David Ayer), who uses Super 16-millimeter film and natural light to fashion a hellhole of heat and thirst strewn with the debris of combat.
Yet the vein-popping mood is ultimately more exhausting than exciting. Where Mr. Cortés used crucial voice work from a handful of notable actors to vary his movie’s tone and lift us, psychologically at least, out of that tomb, Mr. Liman embraces the script’s restrictions. The result is less like a movie and more like a palate-cleansing exercise — something that a big-ticket director might do just to see if he still can." 0.2284754 "Drama" "R" "Roadside Attractions" "" "$897,955 " "$1,803,064 " "" "4" "8-Jan-16" "11-Feb-16" "35" 5

Like Ms. Burshtein’s “Fill the Void” (2013), the story of a religious woman who must decide whether to marry her dead sister’s husband, “The Wedding Plan” manages to be respectful of traditions while at the same time feeling modern, even progressive.
Like “Fill the Void,” “The Wedding Plan” concerns marriage, something that the 32-year-old Michal (Noa Koler) desperately wants. On the verge of tying the knot, she asks her fiancé why he’s seemed distant. He admits that he doesn’t love her, a confession he had been avoiding.
Taking the engagement’s collapse in stride, Michal tallies the years she’s been dating. Impulsively following through on her original plans, she books a wedding hall for the last night of Hanukkah. That gives her three weeks to find a groom — possibly more of a miracle than the Hanukkah lights.
Like Ms. Burshtein, who also wrote the script, Michal doesn’t fit ultra-Orthodox stereotypes. (She runs a mobile petting zoo, which hardly seems like a typical profession.) In a complicated role, the excellent Ms. Koler exudes a kind of flighty confidence: For all her nuptial-related anxieties, Michal is completely comfortable with who she is.
Certainly, the matchmaking industry doesn’t know what to make of her. Michal is set up with a succession of men, including one who is deaf and another who refuses to look at her. (If he only looks at the woman he marries, he explains, she’ll be the most beautiful woman in the world to him.) For a stretch, Michal’s most likely candidate seems to be the nonreligious pop star (Oz Zehavi) she meets on a pilgrimage in Ukraine. Is he toying with her? Is she toying with him?
But “The Wedding Plan” doesn’t settle, as the Hollywood version of this story might have, for offering a cavalcade of comically wrong men. It holds out a few different prospects for Michal and keeps her (and us) guessing until the end. It’s a comedy in the Shakespearean sense — we know it will end with a wedding, groom or not — but Ms. Burshtein leaves open the possibility that it might be a broken one. The hoped-for marriage isn’t just a test of Michal’s happiness but also of her religiosity: A rabbi warns Michal against “counting on miracles,” and wonders what will happen to her faith if she doesn’t find a husband in time.
Ms. Burshtein asks viewers to take a leap of faith as well with a borderline surreal finale, which finds Michal, woozy in close-ups during a fast, trying to comprehend what’s happening around her. It’s a mystical touch — another tipoff that this ordinary-sounding movie is actually pretty special." 0.8913311 "Comedy" "PG" "Roadside Attractions" "" "$31,658 " "$1,412,404 " "" "1" "27-Jul-06" "24-Sep-06" "64" 9.1

There are killings, rapes and beatings, episodes of revenge and casual cruelty, and the subtle but no less brutal operations of poverty, corruption and social injustice. But though we occasionally witness the immediate aftereffect of these acts, we virtually never see the acts themselves. In a departure from the usual cinematic practice that amounts to a critique of prevailing assumptions about the power of visual representation, Mr. Diaz insists that words can carry meaning more effectively than pictures.
Which is not to say that this movie, which won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival last year, is unconcerned with showing what happens. Shot in a black-and-white palette that evokes both Italian neorealism and old television, “The Woman Who Left” is carefully composed and hauntingly beautiful to behold. Like Mr. Diaz’s earlier work, it is long and slow-moving, but at nearly four hours it feels less like a test of your endurance than an appeal to your appetite for character, incident and emotion.
The setting is the modern Philippines (the main action begins in 1997), but the inspiration is “God Sees the Truth, but Waits,” a story by Tolstoy, and the mood and pace evoke the rich pleasures of great 19th-century fiction. Mr. Diaz has explored this kind of transcultural and trans-historical cross-pollination before, notably in “Norte, the End of History,” which drew on Dostoyevsky’s “Crime and Punishment.” “The Woman Who Left” is less sprawling — more portrait than tableau — and it brings to the screen a character who is at once elusive and unforgettable.
Her name is Horacia, though she occasionally hides behind pseudonyms. We first encounter her in a rural women’s prison, where she reads stories to her fellow inmates and tutors their young children. The place seems peaceful and humane (especially in contrast to what will follow), and Horacia, played with exquisite understatement by Charo Santos-Concio, seems resigned to her life there. But then, 30 years into her sentence, she is freed, and we learn that she was framed for murder by a former lover. The real killer confesses and commits suicide, sending Horacia on a journey into a tragic past and an uncertain future.
Mr. Diaz tells her story without flashbacks or gimmicks, with a plainness that masks the complexity of his ambitions. Stoical and selfless, Horacia resembles one of the suffering mothers of classic Hollywood melodrama. And her post-incarceration adventures unfold under film-noir-like shadows. She befriends outcasts and outlaws — notably a transgender prostitute (John Lloyd Cruz) and a street vendor (Nonie Buencamino) — and quietly stalks Rodrigo Trinidad (Michael De Mesa), the man who wronged her.
Handsome and self-confident, Rodrigo lives a life of wealth and power in a gated compound, emerging occasionally to attend Mass and bathe in the flattery of a young priest. He hasn’t paid in any way for the years he stole from Horacia. She observes him from a distance, and it is not clear — perhaps not even to her — whether she is planning to confront or kill him, or if witnessing the unfairness of their respective circumstances is all the justice she can expect.
Mr. Diaz’s view of human affairs is pessimistic. He is fascinated by guilt and innocence but skeptical of the possibility of redemption. Yet his films, this one even more than “Norte,” are the opposite of despairing. The last shots of “The Woman Who Left” are devastating, and the film makes uncompromising demands on your attention and your empathy.

The wife, Ettie (Evelin Hagoel), has just learned that their newly rebuilt Orthodox Jewish synagogue no longer has a separate section for women — which essentially means they have been barred from the gender-segregated services. The slight is a punch in the gut, but it also starts a revolution.
The story begins when the women’s balcony at the synagogue collapses during the bar mitzvah celebration for Ettie’s grandson. The accident leaves the rabbi’s wife in a coma and the rabbi in a state of shock, which puts the future of the congregation in limbo; rabbis have to supervise repairs. So when the charismatic young Rabbi David comes to their rescue, he’s seen as “an angel from heaven.” Rabbi David may be a good man, but he’s not exactly progressive. His more conservative views and strict reading of scripture soon run afoul of the women of this more moderate congregation, especially Ettie. The growing rift threatens to tear apart a few marriages, but there’s never really any doubt about the couples’ eventual reunion, let alone which side will prevail.
Still, Emil Ben-Shimon’s smart direction (tight shots of narrow streets and even narrower dwellings really convey a sense of an insular community) and Shlomit Nehama’s lighthearted and topical script ensure the proceedings not only hit all the right notes, but also entertain while being respectful of religious traditions. The entire cast is solid, but the women, especially Ms. Hagoel, bring depth to their comedic and dramatic turns.

Their guide would be a crusader against such horrors: Mickey Choothesa, who had founded a nongovernmental organization, the Children’s Organization of Southeast Asia (COSA), and had, he said, personally rescued girls from brothels, raising them in a dorm environment and making sure that they were fed and clothed and attended school.
As “The Wrong Light” documents, the inquiry veers in another direction. It’s no spoiler to say that the filmmakers start to believe that the organization is based on a fraud: The very first scene is of Ms. Heitz, stepping out of an interview with a parent who was said to have made such a sale — her first without Mr. Choothesa interpreting. Almost in a daze, she murmurs, “It’s all a big lie.”
The film’s first half chronicles the events leading to that interview; the girls who live at the organization and go to school in Chiang Mai are bright and motivated, and glad for the opportunities their families in the hill tribes of Northern Thailand lack. But they later burst into tears when they hear how they and their families have been presented in materials to donor groups — put, as one says, in “the wrong light.”
Even so, perhaps the families are denying the truth out of shame. The rest of the film tries to determine the facts, though questions remain. In the end, “The Wrong Light” is an engrossing cautionary tale teaching one of philanthropy’s oldest lessons: Caveat emptor." 0.175956969 "Documentary" "Unrated" "Cinema Guild" "" "$55,889 " "$318,574 " "$182,000,000 " "1,590" "16-Dec-88" "" "" NA
"320" "The Zookeeper's Wife" "3/31/2017" "3/29/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/movies/the-zookeepers-wife-review-jessica-chastain.html" 0 "“‘Schindler’s List’ With Pets”: That’s my suggested alternate title for “The Zookeeper’s Wife.” This mild-mannered Holocaust film probably wasn’t conceived as family fare but is so timid and sanitized it almost feels safe for children.
Except for its scenes involving animals, this handsome, excessively fastidious screen adaptation of Diane Ackerman’s 2007 nonfiction best seller is a polite but pallid recycling of Holocaust movie tropes with epic pretensions. The book tells the true story of a Polish couple who rescued about 300 Jews from the Warsaw ghetto during the Holocaust and sheltered them in their zoo.
What does it say that the most stirring scenes in a movie that avoids graphic depictions of Nazi barbarism involve the heroic title character, Antonina Zabinska (Jessica Chastain), lovingly interacting with the animals in the Warsaw Zoo, which she runs with her husband, Jan (Johan Heldenbergh)?
In these tender moments, “The Zookeeper’s Wife,” directed by Niki Caro (“Whale Rider”), from an anemic screenplay by Angela Workman, shucks off its modesty and transforms into the sentimental portrait of a beautiful woman and the animals she cares for like a devoted parent. You can trust animals, but not people, she declares.
Her beloved charges get more screen time than the Jews whose lives the couple saves and who mostly remain anonymous, their personal stories left untold. They creep out of hiding and convene like a ghostly family when Antonina signals them by playing the piano.
The most emotional scene has nothing to do with Nazis, Jews or the Holocaust. In this surefire set piece, which feels shoehorned into the film, Antonina saves the life of a baby elephant to which she administers CPR, risking being trampled by the adorable creature’s agitated mother. Otherwise, “The Zookeeper’s Wife” plays like a medium-gloss rerun of other more gripping depictions of Nazi evil and Jewish suffering.
It at least sustains a cool pictorial grandeur in its portrayal of the Nazi invasion of Poland as bombers sweep the skies and armored tanks roll into Warsaw as the city erupts in panic, its peace and quiet shattered in one horrifying instant. As bombs rain on the zoo, the frightened, confused animals run wild in the streets, and amid the chaos an elephant is shot.
After the invasion, Antonina and Jan are greeted with unctuous cordiality by Lutz Heck (Daniel Brühl), a suave Nazi zoologist who offers to transport the zoo’s most prized animals to Berlin for safekeeping. During their stay, he says, he plans to use them for selective breeding.
To keep the zoo from being closed, the quick-witted couple come up with the idea of converting it into a hog farm, which would produce meat to feed the German soldiers. The animals subsist on garbage retrieved from the Warsaw ghetto in daily truck runs. Jan’s plan is to smuggle Jews hidden under the refuse to the zoo, where they are secreted in the basement of the house occupied by the family, which includes their young son, Ryszard (played at different ages by Timothy Radford and Val Maloku).
There are ample opportunities for the movie to stir up fear each time the truck leaves the ghetto, but the film has little appetite for cliffhanging suspense. The fugitives who emerge from under the garbage don’t look much the worse for wear. Although not without moments of terror and desperation, the screenplay’s leisurely timing subverts their dramatic impact.
A subplot involves Antonina’s precarious balancing act as she charms the besotted Lutz, and resists surrendering to his increasingly aggressive moves as her jealous husband watches nervously from a distance. The screenplay is so frightened of this material that it isn’t always clear whether she has succumbed. But as Lutz evolves from a charmer into a bad, bad Nazi, the question of did she or didn’t she give in seems a feeble attempt to pump romantic excitement into a drama in dire need of moral complexity.
Ms. Chastain’s watchful, layered performance helps keep the film on an even keel, but it is not enough to prevent “The Zookeeper’s Wife,” with its reassuringly cuddly critters, from feeling like a Disney version of the Holocaust." 0.408967436 "Biography" "PG-13" "Focus Features" "" "" "$17,571,660 " "" "9" "20-Jun-12" "" "212" 30.3
"321" "Their Finest" "4/7/2017" "4/6/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/movies/their-finest-review.html" 0 "Love and laughter flow so naturally in “Their Finest” that it is almost (almost) easy to forget there’s a war on. An unalloyed charmer, the movie tells a story of familiar British grit and resolve during World War II from an attractively different angle: that of an advertising copywriter, Catrin Cole (Gemma Arterton), who’s recruited by the government to join the film industry. Britain wants the United States to enter the war, and has decided cinematic propaganda is the way it can persuade the movie-mad Yanks to sign up. The world is facing a historic catastrophe, after all; but for this ambitious young woman it’s also a bittersweet opportunity.
It’s the latest addition to an appealing British subgenre: the home-front story that reminds you that among grim air raids and explosions, people also just lived their lives, sometimes with laughter and unexpected new freedoms, as in John Boorman’s 1987 autobiographical film, “Hope and Glory,” about childhood during the Blitz. The director of “Their Finest,” Lone Scherfig, is Danish (her breakthrough was “Italian for Beginners”), but she has carved out a curious niche making British period stories, most notably “An Education.” She has fine timing and wit — the behind-the-scenes filmmaking sections in “Their Finest” are delightful, note-perfect sendups — and while her visuals tend to be overly buffed, she’s more ambitious with her performers, who retain their rough, human edges.
After being called up to duty, Catrin is paired with Tom Buckley (Sam Claflin), a dyspeptic screenwriter who nonetheless grasps her talent. With British men off fighting the Nazis, the domestic film industry needs all the help it can get, even if this means deviating from its entrenched sexism. For Catrin, who’s shacked up in a bleak London flat with her husband, Ellis (Jack Huston), the new career and its opportunities are as welcome as the pay. La vie bohème doesn’t seem to be cutting it, especially because Ellis — a struggling painter given to slashing, cluttered canvases in shades of dung (the movie is clearly on the side of the popular arts) — insists on stirring up trouble.
Adapted by Gabby Chiappe from a novel by Lissa Evans, “Their Finest” settles into focus once Catrin and Buckley start working on a film intended to rally the United States to the cause. Initially assigned to writing “the slop,” or women’s dialogue, Catrin quickly rises to the occasion, typing reams of dialogue while gracefully, sometimes messily navigating a crowd of tetchy narcissists, mostly male. Even with so many men away at war, Catrin is outnumbered at work, which makes sense, given the film industry. Yet partly because “Their Finest” is so wonderfully cast, both Ms. Arterton and her character often come close to being upstaged by their scene-stealing male cohort, a somewhat perilous turn for a female-driven story about a woman finding herself and her voice.
A pleasant, somewhat stolid presence, Ms. Arterton nonetheless manages, mostly through sheer screen time, to create a character who can hold her own against these free-ranging peacocks, none prouder and screechier than Buckley, a romantic foil whose sourness Mr. Claflin keeps in check with glints of soul. It’s an alluring performance, pitched between leathery guardedness and vulnerability, and spiked with the genial self-abnegation that defined Hugh Grant’s early career. Mr. Claflin could have run off with “Their Finest,” except that he’s just one in a gang of wily thieves who include Eddie Marsan, Jeremy Irons, Jake Lacy, Richard E. Grant (king of the reaction shots) and that sly puss Bill Nighy as a faded star in permanent high dudgeon over his career.
As the film-within-the film progresses and as Catrin struggles with her own drama (and romantic agonies worthy of a classic women’s picture), a few others muscle into the boys’ club, including Phyl (Rachael Stirling), a dispenser of feminist truths in slacks. The character who most beautifully embodies the story’s ideals, though, is Sophie (Helen McCrory), who, as a talent agent, brings man and dog to heel in a few short, barbed scenes. She’s the kind of no-nonsense woman you can imagine contributed to the real war effort, including in the film industry. “Their Finest” is too understandably serious to be called a romp, yet it has a buoyancy that lifts you and, in Ms. McCrory, a woman who does, too." 0.99777172 "Comedy" "R" "STX Entertainment" "" "$76,197 " "$3,603,484 " "" "3" "11-Mar-05" "13-Mar-05" "7" 1
"322" "Thor: Ragnarok" "11/3/2017" "11/1/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/movies/thor-ragnarok-review-chris-hemsworth.html" 0 "There’s a nice bit in “Thor: Ragnarok,” the latest Marvel blowout to feature the god of thunder, where he tries to start a jet using a voice-activated password. He needs to make a getaway — he’s neck deep in trouble and plot entanglements — so identifies himself as the “strongest Avenger.” No dice. Given his earlier stand-alone movies, Thor might have had better luck cracking the code if he’d copped to being the “most boring Avenger.”
Through no fault of their likable star, Chris Hemsworth, the Thor movies have been largely forgettable, memorable mostly for the upstaging antics of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and as a bad fit for Natalie Portman (Thor’s former love interest, now mercifully banished into the storytelling cornfield). “Ragnarok” tries hard to change that profile, and mostly succeeds by knocking its big, blond beauty consistently down to size. It makes sense for all sorts of reasons, including that superheroes can so easily appear to be on the wrong side of history, especially those who look like Aryan cartoons.
That isn’t Thor’s fault; he was drawn that way. But times change, and a conceptual makeover was necessary — and not just to boost his box-office appeal. Marvel could have gone grimmer, broodier and sterner, but that isn’t its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier, sillier and funnier. It’s a good fit, at least for a while. Like some other superheroes, Thor has been good for the occasional light, mocking laugh, often hooked to his otherworldly identity: He’s a god (as he likes to announce), son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and so forth. For much of “Ragnarok,” he’s a playfully sustained joke.
As a storyteller, the director Taika Waititi (“Hunt for the Wilderpeople”) has a charmingly idiosyncratic human touch and a gift for turning goofiness and gab into personality. That gift is first evident here in the intimate huddles between Thor and whoever happens to be within chatting (or shouting) distance. There’s a lot of yakking, some barking; at one point, Odin does some god-splaining. The Chatty Cathies also include Thor’s sister, Hela (a vamping Cate Blanchett), an overgrown Goth Girl with smudged eye makeup and killer dominatrix looks who plays very hard. She lusts for Odin’s realm, which remains as drearily amorphous and anonymous as before.
The story is an uninteresting thicket of brawls, machinations and useful coincidences. (Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay.) Soon after Hela appears, she moves back home and Thor lands elsewhere, allowing her to run amok — kill, strut, repeat — and him to leisurely settle into his new, more lighthearted mode until it’s serious hammer time. Much of his great un-Thoring happens on Sakaar, a planetary garbage dump run by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum, comically jiving and dithering), a psychopath Auntie Mame in flowing gold lamé and blue fingernail polish who suggests a low-rent version of Stanley Tucci’s host in “The Hunger Games.”
The Grandmaster presides over a gladiatorial game, an exasperatingly lazy and uninteresting story development that is mostly (mostly) alleviated by Mr. Waititi’s handling of the material. It’s here that the vibe relaxes and the picture’s filigree becomes brighter and wittier as extras with puffball hairdos straight out of Dr. Seuss light up the background. It’s also here that Thor reunites with the Hulk, who’s been crushing the gladiatorial competition on an extended incredible bender. After he and Thor engage in some Steinbeckian George-and-Lennie riffing, the Hulk’s inner mouse, Bruce Banner, takes over, and Mark Ruffalo eases in to help turn the temperature from hot to cozy.
Mr. Hemsworth looks happier and far more relaxed in “Ragnarok” than he did in the previous Thor vehicles, which is perhaps Mr. Waititi’s truest achievement here. For a guy who looks chiseled by Michelangelo, Mr. Hemsworth can be a surprisingly agile physical performer, capable of real bounce, and he clearly likes ricocheting off walls as much as he does ceding center stage to the other actors. These include Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, who, after an unpromising entrance, develops into a real character with emotion and an all-too-brief flashback filled with fury, beauty, liquid motion and mythological mystery.
That scene is a jolt, because it’s a reminder of the narrative ambition and mythic grandeur that’s often reduced in this franchise to epic fights, fancy elocution and special effects. It’s amusing how “Ragnarok” humanizes Thor, yet in doing so it dilutes his Thorness, the essential qualities that make him more than a dude with a cool hammer. And the more familiar and less godlike he becomes, the more evident it is that this series has never figured out how to make his myth fit with the modern world. So it’s made Thor a fish out of water and a recurrent punch line. Now, though, with Thor (and Mr. Hemsworth) at last settled in, what he needs is a myth as mighty as his shtick." 0.718580371 "Action" "PG-13" "Buena Vista" "$180,000,000 " "$122,744,989 " "" "" "1,852" "19-Mar-99" "" "" NA
"323" "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri" "11/10/2017" "11/8/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/movies/review-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-martin-mcdonagh.html" 0 "At one point in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” Frances McDormand tears the movie open, showing you what a broken heart looks like. It happens during an uneasily intimate encounter between her character, a tough number named Mildred, and an ailing police chief, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). Until then, Mildred has seemed impervious to his pain. She has rented three billboards attacking his failure to solve her daughter’s murder — one reads “Raped While Dying” — and has been so wrapped up in her hurt that she hasn’t seen anyone else’s. When she realizes how sick Willoughby is, she looks at him as if for the first time. She’s staggered, and so are you.
The pain of others haunts “Three Billboards,” at least whenever the writer-director Martin McDonagh lets it. A playwright (“The Pillowman”) turned filmmaker (“In Bruges”) who’s somewhat of a subgenre unto himself, Mr. McDonagh is a pain artist whose tools include absurd violence, cruel laughs and sucker punches. He skated through his last movie, “Seven Psychopaths,” a barely there comedy that pivots on a creatively stalled screenwriter. As this précis suggests, Mr. McDonagh doesn’t have much to say in that movie — it has a bunny, stolen dogs, guys with guns, good and bad jokes — but what little is said is said by very fine performers grooving on all his words and larky nonsense.
“Three Billboards” is more ambitious than Mr. McDonagh’s earlier features. Like the older ones, it has loads of gab, plenty of guns and the spectacle of men (mainly) behaving terribly. It also restlessly, if not satisfyingly, shifts between comedy and tragedy — a McDonagh specialty — splattering blood along the way. This time, though, he has also given his movie characters instead of disposable contrivances, a plot instead of self-reflexive ideas about storytelling and a rather diffuse overarching metaphor. Mostly, he has freighted it with a tragedy that allows the performers — primarily Ms. McDormand but also the equally excellent Mr. Harrelson and Sam Rockwell — to play to their range.
The movie opens on low boil with Mildred behind the wheel of her station wagon near three derelict billboards. It’s an inviting landscape smudged with soft color, but as she stares at the signs with furrowed intensity, she chews on a fingernail so ferociously she seems on the verge of tearing it off. The billboards aren’t blank — the faded image of a baby smiles down from one, the word “life” pops off another — but they’re the opening pages in Mildred’s opus. Stamping black text against a blood-red background, she uses the billboards to announce her crusade while Mr. McDonagh (who likes self-aware gestures) lays out the story’s fundamentals: its setting, characters, problem, plot and possible villain.
The billboards are a gimmick for Mr. McDonagh and a gambit for Mildred, a way to get things jumping (the investigators, the tale) and splash some foreboding on an outwardly pacific scene. Much of the story involves the ripples of outrage, confusion and buffoonery that the billboards inspire and that soon envelop almost everyone Mildred knows. Months after her daughter’s death, grief has walled her in; isolating and seemingly impenetrable, it is inscribed in the hardness of her gaze and in her grim new identity as a mother of a dead girl. The billboards turn that grief into a weapon, a means of taking on the law and assorted men — a threatening stranger, a vigilante dentist and an abusive ex (John Hawkes) — who collectively suggest another wall that has closed Mildred in.
Mr. McDonagh likes to play comedy against violence and to wring laughs out of the unspeakable. This kind of juxtaposition (in his movies, at any rate) can produce laughter that catches in your throat, giving you pause and maybe provoking thought about why exactly you are giggling. But he doesn’t always know his A material from his B, or doesn’t care; his jokes can be uninterestingly glib with tiny, bloodless pricks that are less about challenging the audience than about obscuring the material’s clichés and overriding theatricality. Everything fits together too neatly in “Three Billboards,” even when chaos descends, but the performers add enough rough texture so that it doesn’t always feel so worked.
Ms. McDormand roughs it up beautifully. A performer of great unforced naturalism, she has always come across more like a character actor than a star, even when she has the lead. She never seems concerned about losing the audience’s love or its sympathy, which can be thrilling, particularly given that female performers are often asked to pander or seduce. In this movie, she makes pain so palpably all-encompassing that you see it in her character’s every glance and gesture: It squares Mildred’s jaw, hardens her mouth and turns her face to stone, as if she were further fortifying her defenses. But pain also makes her ugly, maybe irredeemable, which also makes her joltingly, excitingly human.
That same stone face is good for comedy, too, even if Mr. McDonagh’s bids at humor grow progressively less successful. He plays with tones, realisms and ideas in “Three Billboards,” including the sentimentally redeemed white racist, a character that suggests — despite the rage and invective — that Mr. McDonagh holds out hope for humanity after all. The problem is that the idea he hits most insistently is that vengeance is the hurt that never subsides; it’s the hurt that Mildred nurtures and that hardens her and that, over time, becomes so brutally consuming its violence is all but indistinguishable from its cause.

Not that I wasn’t open to persuasion. For one thing, this staid biopic was prettily filmed in my beloved Scotland and directed by Jason Connery (the son of Sean Connery). And for another, it stars the great Peter Mullan, who broke my heart almost 20 years ago in “My Name Is Joe” and has had a place in there ever since. Here, he plays the 19th-century golf pioneer Tom Morris, four-time winner of what’s now known as the British Open and master caddy and greenskeeper to the toffs at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews.
For much of the movie, Tom will butt heads with his willful son, Tommy (Jack Lowden), whose golfing talent soon outpaces his father’s and whose aversion to forelock-tugging angers the aristocrats who sponsor their tournaments — and pocket most of the winnings.
“Your station in life was set before you were born,” admonishes the club captain (a wily Sam Neill).

This French documentary convincingly explains why those views are gravely misguided, but its real triumph is its pervasive feeling of hope.
It’s refreshing to see concrete solutions at work, many of them at the grass-roots level. And the optimism of those countering ineffective politicians and big business is infectious. The filmmakers — the French actress Mélanie Laurent and the civic activist Cyril Dion — interview their subjects during an intercontinental expedition that takes them to Detroit and Todmorden, England, where urban gardening initiatives flourish; San Francisco, which has an enviable recycling and composting program; Normandy, France, where intercropping ensures that “each plant plays a role in the ecosystem”; a village near Chennai, India, whose decentralized democracy reflects the residents’ priorities; Copenhagen, with its renewable energy model and biking culture; and many points in between.
At times, it feels as if the strikingly composed “Tomorrow” — fast-paced and divided into chapters focusing on food, energy, the economy, democracy and education — would have better served viewers as a multi-episode documentary series, with each theme getting its own segment. Yet the editing team helps evoke an overall sense of lighthearted adventure; the narration is punchy and personal; the pop score (mostly by Fredricka Stahl) is catchy; and the hopscotching visuals are as vibrant as the subjects profiled.

Two high school social media stars and secretly budding serial killers, Sadie and McKayla, are holding a school assembly for one of their victims, a fellow cheerleader who got fresh about McKayla’s choice of sneakers. As their sanctimonious In Memoriam slide show plays, the dates of the fallen cheer captain’s birth and death flash onscreen, bringing a sickly realization more frightening than any kill: These teenagers were all born in the year 2000.
“Tragedy Girls” updates the slasher genre by identifying personal branding as the horror that trends with the millennial teen.

But — surprise — the fifth “Transformers” movie, “The Last Knight,” is far from the worst in this continuing experiment in noisy nonsense based on Hasbro toys. That is thanks largely to two words: Anthony Hopkins.
What Mr. Hopkins, a knighted Emmy and Oscar winner, is doing in a “Transformers” movie is unclear, but he brings a goofy dignity to the enterprise that elevates this chapter over its recent brethren. The storytelling is also an upgrade. For one thing, we finally are given a believable explanation for the purpose of Stonehenge.
Mark Wahlberg, who joined the franchise in the fourth film, the unwatchably long and convoluted “Transformers: Age of Extinction,” is back as the scruffy inventor Cade Yeager.
As this story opens, Cade is one of the few humans who still has some affection for Autobots, the robotic immigrants from outer space who mean well but whose war with the Decepticons has resulted in all sorts of havoc on Earth. The rest of humanity is still annoyed with them for wrecking a perfectly good city, Chicago, earlier in the franchise.
Autobots and Decepticons transform into motor vehicles and other things, a special-effects sight that apparently never grows old for fans of the series. And they have what seems like an ever-changing back story. The one conjured here involves Arthur, Lancelot, Merlin and the Dark Ages, which is where Mr. Hopkins’s character, Edmund Burton, comes in.
He’s a sort of keeper of the Arthurian/Transformers legend, and he knows that a long-forecast climactic battle is coming for control of Merlin’s staff, an ancient relic that has formidable powers when wielded by the right person.
In this case that person is Viviane (Laura Haddock), a British scholar who is skeptical of the Round Table tales and is also just the right age to be a potential romantic interest for Cade. As for Stonehenge, well, without giving away too much, let’s just say that invaders from space are coming to suck the life out of our planet, and the great monument is not merely the clunkiest calendar ever made.
Also in the mix are Lennox (Josh Duhamel), the military man from the previous movies; Jimmy (Jerrod Carmichael), Cade’s jokey sidekick; and Izabella (Isabela Moner), the obligatory cute kid. The best touch, though, is Cogman (the voice of Jim Carter), Edmund’s robotic butler, a sort of C-3PO with a temper (as a robot who aims a C-3PO joke at him finds out).
This movie series can only wish it had the depth and coherence of the “Star Wars” franchise, but the homage is nice, and Cogman and Edmund have some witty moments, something the more plodding sequels lacked.
Michael Bay again directs, and he and his writers (Art Marcum, Matt Holloway and Ken Nolan are credited with the screenplay, and those three along with Akiva Goldsman with the story) put more humanity and less clanking into this installment. Mr. Bay seems to rein in his tendency for high-speed pursuits and robotic clashes somewhat, and he varies the vroom-vroom car-chase stuff by throwing in a submarine chase.
But don’t worry; if for some reason the drawn-out and incoherent battle scenes are what you liked about the earlier films, the climactic one here is still both of those things.

"328" "Trophy" "9/8/2017" "9/7/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/movies/trophy-review.html" 1 "“Trophy,” an extraordinary documentary from Shaul Schwarz and Christina Clusiau, is filled with astonishing sights. An American hunter welling up over the body of the lion he has just shot; a South African rhino breeder calmly sawing the horns off his helpless charges. The intimacy of the film’s images and the surprising candor of its participants are disarming: Whatever your initial response, be prepared to re-evaluate.
Wading hip-deep into the moral, emotional and economic confluence of big-game hunting and wildlife conservation, the movie reveals a world where animals must pay for their keep or risk extinction. From a hunt in Namibia to a safari lodge in South Africa, from an animal control program in Zimbabwe to a Las Vegas convention hall, the narrative becomes only more complex and confounding. At any moment, whoever is onscreen — the hunter who believes he has a God-given right to shoot animals; the anti-poaching officer whose work is financed in part by the hunting industry; the poor villagers endangered by animals that the wealthy pay to kill — might challenge our assumptions and expose our ignorance.
Layered, thoughtful and infinitely curious, “Trophy” is shot so simply and beautifully, and with such nonjudgmental calm, that it’s easy to miss the ingenuity of its construction. Intervening solely to offer the occasional devastating statistic, the filmmakers allow our perceptions to shift and slide with each new piece of information. Here, canny businessman and genuine animal lover share the same skin, and a high-end safari outfitter is no less concerned for his beasts than the most vehement anti-hunting activist.

The Vulture writer Kyle Buchanan has already provided a rundown of the substantial delays in the film’s release, which — for a project once regarded as an Oscar contender — might be taken as a sign of an odor other than floral. This week, Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of the Weinstein Company, the film’s distributor, took the extraordinary step of defending the movie in advance with a column for Deadline Hollywood, though it is laced with passive-aggressive barbs like “I know this film’s not perfect, very few are, but it’s a perfectly good time in a movie theater.”
Plenty of movies fit that description — and considering the hoopla, the most disappointing thing about “Tulip Fever,” directed by Justin Chadwick (“The Other Boleyn Girl”) and set in 17th-century Amsterdam, is that it’s neither a secret masterpiece nor a laughable disaster. True, there is the scene in which Jan (Dane DeHaan), the hunky portraitist having an affair with Sophia (Alicia Vikander), the unhappily married wife of a merchant, explains to her that the key to their escape is to bet big in the Dutch tulip market. “All we have to do is put all our eggs in one basket,” he says.
Howlers like that are few and far between, though, in a script credited to Tom Stoppard and Deborah Moggach, adapting her own novel, that faithfully follows the template for overripe period dramas. The re-creation of Amsterdam in the Golden Age is credible, the sweeping camera moves look like a great workout, and the compositions suggest someone studied Vermeer. There is also a fascination with the milieu, in which speculators, owing to tulips’ value at the time, would bid on bulbs, prizing rare varieties and creating a soaring market that ultimately crashed. Even an abbess (Judi Dench) gets in on the action.
Alas, the movie is not “The Wolf of Waalstraat” and more directly concerns a familiar love triangle. To ensure her siblings’ passage to New Amsterdam, the city that became New York, the orphaned Sophia has married Cornelis Sandvoort (Christoph Waltz), described as “the king of peppercorns.” Despite his ritualized lovemaking, she fails to conceive an heir. When her servant, Maria (Holliday Grainger, who also narrates) becomes pregnant by the fishmonger (Jack O’Connell), Sophia proposes a scheme in which Cornelis can keep the baby. In the meantime, Sophia must merely pretend to be pregnant while Maria pretends not to be. This unconvincing charade culminates in one of the silliest birth scenes in recent memory.
The star turns — including one from Zach Galifianakis as the sort of drunk you do not want to entrust with your nest egg — stave off boredom, but the most disappointing thing about the end to the speculative bubble surrounding “Tulip Fever” is that there isn’t much there." 0.075787381 "Drama" "R" "Weinstein Company" "" "$1,158,017 " "$2,455,635 " "" "5" "11-Mar-16" "1-Dec-16" "154" 22

Provoked by hellish suburbs and rural moonscapes outside San Francisco, a group of outsiders cobbled together loud, angry music that was also a reaction against the hippie generation before it. The movie follows this winding time line until its focus shifts to a famous hub, the 924 Gilman Street music collective in Berkeley, Calif., that nurtured bands like Green Day (an executive producer of the movie), Rancid, Operation Ivy, the Offspring and even the filmmaker Miranda July.
Mr. Redford, who wrote the movie with Anthony Marchitiello, shows enthusiasm for his subject but offers little context for newcomers to West Coast punk music. Interviewees remember names fondly but don’t illuminate why those people were crucial to the scene or what happened to them, leaving everyone behind but die-hard fans who are already in the know.
Via voice-over narration, the punk elder statesman Iggy Pop presides over the nearly 160-minute parade of musician cameos and archival footage, but his scraggly-voiced guidance returns only intermittently to connect the dots between the years.

A Madea Halloween” arrived in theaters. It was hardly distinguished, but it had its moments, largely because of the comic interactions between the outrageous, finely aged characters Madea and Joe (both played by Mr. Perry) and their fellow dyspeptic senior citizens, Hattie (Patrice Lovely) and Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis).
“Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,” which, as usual with Mr. Perry’s pictures, wasn’t screened in advance for critics, frequently feels more like a remake than a sequel. The movie revisits Brian Simmons (Mr. Perry), a single dad, and his rebellious teenage daughter, Tiffany (Diamond White). The respect-your-parents and don’t-even-think-about-having-sex lessons of the previous film have long been forgotten by the characters; if anything, Tiffany, now turning 18, is snottier, and Brian more passive. (The movie introduces an ex-wife, played by Taja V. Simpson, who walks all over him and is too permissive with Tiffany.)
Once again Tiffany is determined to attend a frat party. And, yes, it’s the same inhabited-by-30-year-olds frat from the first film. The twist this time is the fellas aren’t allowed to have a party in the house, so instead they’re having it at Derrick Lake, which was (cue scary music) the scene of a still-apparently-shrouded-in-mystery (with this shoddy script it’s hard to really tell) mass murder back in the 1970s. Rumor has it some kind of massacre-seeking entity haunts the premises.
The prospect of Mr. Perry’s rambunctious Madea possibly taking on a Jason Voorhees-type killer has an amusement value that is not even vaguely realized here. This movie finds Mr. Perry, never the most deft at the technical aspect of filmmaking, drastically off whatever his best game is. Every camera setup is a study in inertia; every other cut is a beat or two behind where a punch line needs to land. To call this movie unwatchable would be inaccurate, though the scenes featuring Mike Tornabene and Yousef Erakat, portraying frat brothers who act as if they are dying to reassemble a group of Dead End Kids for Sidney Kingsley’s play, are pretty painful. On the other hand, the lighting is so weak, “Boo 2!” is quite often close to unseeable." 0.015864434 "Comedy" "PG-13" "Lionsgate" "$25,000,000 " "$21,226,953 " "$47,319,572 " "" "307" "10-Apr-87" "21-May-87" "" NA

Any hope of a similarly limber fifth outing dies immediately in “Underworld: Blood Wars.” This film is so heavy with exposition that you would think that the director, Anna Foerster, and the screenwriter, Cory Goodman, had set out to complete a dissertation instead of a sequel.
Returning, in her full leather get-up, is Selene (Kate Beckinsale, somehow still invested), a vampire “death dealer” wanted by both sides. Apparently, her blood and the blood of her daughter (who has gone into hiding since the last movie) can confer special powers on those infused with it — a property that has made the strains sought after by the vampire council member Semira (Lara Pulver) and a Lycan leader, Marius (Tobias Menzies).
With an almost willful lack of fun, “Underworld: Blood Wars” introduces new dangers (self-propelled bullets and nightshade — fatal for some vampires, but only painful and paralyzing for Selene) and backdrops, including a vampire outpost in the frozen north and what must be history’s dullest vampire soiree. (After so many years undead, who could party?)

This one has two accomplished stars, Rosario Dawson and Katherine Heigl, and Ms. Dawson, especially, does creditable work, but it doesn’t matter because the format is so numbingly familiar. Ms. Heigl, looking carved out of ice, plays Tessa, who has not been coping well with her divorce from David (Geoff Stults). When he develops a serious relationship with Julia (Ms. Dawson), Tessa sets a diabolical plot in motion.
The setup may vary — sometimes it’s an unbalanced roommate, or a surrogate mother, or a sexy nanny who gets that homicidal look in the eye — but it’s the same three-cornered dynamic. Here, both the director (Denise Di Novi) and the writer (Christina Hodson) are women, yet that doesn’t translate into a reimagining of the tired formula. Tessa and David have a young daughter (Isabella Kai Rice) who becomes a pawn in the deadly game, and Julia is given a back story involving an abusive boyfriend, but the tale still plays out the same way these yarns always do.
That’s dismaying, because although this is a female-centered movie, the women’s roles are not exactly empowering. The formula demands that one character be bonkers and that the other not be smart enough to realize how unhinged her adversary is until it’s too late.

Instead of Cold War chess moves in the mode of “Funeral in Berlin,” it serves up the ostensible threat of Islamist terror. Racine is an undercover C.I.A. agent posing as an employment counselor in London. She’s loath to do fieldwork because she feels responsible for not thwarting a terrorist strike in Paris years ago. But she’s pulled back in by the prospect of a horrifying biological attack. She needs to interrogate — “unlock” in spy-speak — a courier whose message could set the plan in motion, or stop it.
And here the movie goes very old school, piling on spy thriller tropes: double crosses; chases; a stock taciturn white-haired would-be assassin (who, conveniently enough, can’t quite draw a bead on our heroine); an eager recruit who might as well be nicknamed Dead Meat; and dialogue like “I’m thinking I’m the only friend you’ve got.”

And while it affects an estimated 1 million Americans and 17 million globally, those with the condition are often dismissed as suffering from psychosomatic disorders.
If nothing else, “Unrest,” by Jennifer Brea, demonstrates just how debilitating chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, can be. Ms. Brea, herself a victim, was a well-traveled Ph.D. student at Harvard who fell ill after a high fever in 2011. Along with exhaustion, she experienced loss of muscle control, the inability to speak coherently, pain, and extreme sensitivity to light and noise. Specialists at first concluded that she was dehydrated or stressed; one even suggested a delayed reaction to some childhood trauma that she might not recall.
In trying to understand chronic fatigue syndrome, Ms. Brea found other sufferers online and includes some of their stories here — a young Englishwoman bedridden for eight years, a Danish girl kept against her will in a psychiatric hospital for three years. Other interviews lightly sketch the history of the medical response to the syndrome, and how utterly insufficient it seems to be. Research money is only a small fraction, the film says, of that for multiple sclerosis, a condition afflicting roughly half as many Americans.
Mainly, though, “Unrest” is a video diary and, as such, is not always easy to watch. Ms. Brea bravely spares very little in showing how the disease literally leveled her life — at times leaving her crawling the floor — and strained her marriage. The film is also not vested in an upbeat ending.

The film carries a trace of the sweep of a great screen epic along with the straightforward, explanatory qualities of mass-audience TV, and is never less than absorbing.
Smoothly interweaving the perspectives of British rulers at the viceroy’s house in Delhi and those of their Indian staff, it offers a surprisingly sympathetic portrait of the motives of Lord Mountbatten (Hugh Bonneville), Britain’s last viceroy to colonial India, who oversaw the transfer of power. That process is still hotly debated: The partition of India, which created an independent India and Pakistan, led to the displacement of more than 10 million people and mass carnage in the resulting violence.
Gurinder Chadha, the British-raised director of “Bend It Like Beckham,” closes the film with an ode to her grandmother, who sought refuge from Pakistan in India. As its personal entry point, the film offers a love story between Jeet (Manish Dayal), a Hindu who works as one of Mountbatten’s servants, and Aalia (Huma Qureshi), a Muslim who is betrothed to someone else and may end up on the opposite side of a new border.
Famous figures — including Mohandas K. Gandhi (Neeraj Kabi), Jawaharlal Nehru (Tanveer Ghani) and Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Denzil Smith) — are supporting but pivotal players.

“Based on real events … mostly,” reads a text at the movie’s opening. Queen Victoria’s first encounters with Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal), an Indian functionary sent to Britain to present her with a ceremonial coin, are in comedic scenes that lampoon the pomp of her court. The material is broad, and funny. The Queen is struck by Abdul’s bearing and handsomeness, and soon enough is receiving him in private audiences and having him tutor her in Urdu. He becomes her “munshi” (teacher) and his presence in her life invigorates her. Much to the displeasure of her actual court, including her son and heir “Bertie” (a.k.a. Edward VII), played with a beard and fiercely indignant eyebrows by Eddie Izzard.
In the shift from comedy to drama the movie goes wobbly. The narrative of cross-cultural understanding by way of individual affinity is a comforting but ultimately dubious one.

Part romance, part crime drama, the story opens as Vincent (Emile Hirsch) mysteriously flees a big city to return to his tiny hometown. As he’s leaving, he meets Roxxy (Zoë Kravitz), whom he helps escape from a gun-wielding brute; before long, she has moved into a trailer outside the house Vincent shares with his brother, JC (Emory Cohen).
The terse title characters then spend a good part of the film circling each other and quietly flirting — they’re more sulky than sexy — as a sense of menace pervades the scenes: A crew of local losers goads Vincent and JC into fights, while past enemies threaten to track down the prospective lovers.
Gary Michael Schultz, the director, is committed to restraint — he’s in no rush to get to the action, not when there’s mood-building to be done. It’s a gamble that usually pays off. His screenwriting skills (in a story credited to him and Keith Kjarval) aren’t as steadfast. It’s doubly disappointing to wait for a laconic character to say something, only to hear a line (“You don’t even know me!”) that sounds so clichéd.
Still, aspirations matter, and the cast members remain dedicated to their brooding roles as the script admirably reaches for emotions it only sometimes captures. That is until Mr. Schultz lets loose with an extraordinarily savage ending. If you can resist covering your eyes, it’s worth watching for the primitive satisfaction that payback elicits.

One night, aided by the serendipitous convergence of a delayed train and a dead cellphone battery, he slips out of his routine and into an odd kind of exile. Instead of walking in the front door to greet his wife, Diana, and their twin daughters, Wakefield betakes himself to a storage room above the garage, where he can observe his own absence through a small window.
He remains there for months, becoming something of a living poltergeist, invisibly haunting the domestic space that had once belonged to him. There are other ways to describe him: as a creepy voyeur, sadistically observing the pain and confusion his departure has caused; as a mock-heroic dissident, rejecting the emptiness and inauthenticity of modern middle-class existence; or even, more philosophically, as “the Outcast of the Universe.”
That last phrase comes from a sketch, also called “Wakefield,” by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The movie, written and directed by Robin Swicord and starring Bryan Cranston and Jennifer Garner, isn’t based on that tale, but on a much longer 2008 story by E. L. Doctorow, which elegantly updates and expands some of Hawthorne’s themes. The idea of escape — specifically the male fantasy of flight from a supposedly female-dominated world of family and responsibility — is at least as old as Rip Van Winkle, and Doctorow’s text is in part a sly and self-conscious commentary on that literary tradition. His Wakefield is a creature of words, less a man than a conceit.
In spite of Mr. Cranston’s guile and grit, Ms. Swicord’s “Wakefield” is something less than that. The film, scrupulously faithful to its source, is decidedly literary, but not in an especially satisfying way. In its view of suburban discontent and masculine malaise, it leans on borrowed insights and an unearned aura of significance. Too mannered for realism and too thin for fable, it spins its wheels in a social and intellectual void filled only by Wakefield’s voice-over musings and the shadow of Doctorow’s virtuosity.
Wakefield watches as Diana’s initial shock gives way to grief and then — maybe a little too quickly — to resignation, and he reminisces about their courtship and early marriage. She was a dancer when they met, dating a friend of his (Jason O’Mara), and Wakefield narrates with cruel relish the way he stole her affections and spirited her away to the suburbs. There, she raised the children and worked at an art museum, while he feathered the nest and rode the Metro-North rails.
Now, his clothes filthy and his beard overgrown, Wakefield ventures out at night to scavenge his neighbors’ trash. On occasions when he goes out in daylight, he is confident that no one will recognize him. His emotions swing from liberation to anguish, with a consistent note of contempt — for his family, for his circumstances and above all for himself.
None of it is quite believable. Ms. Swicord — and Mr. Cranston, too — seem trapped in Wakefield’s solipsism. On the page, other people can be perceived through the screen of a narrator’s consciousness: Diana’s unreality is a symptom of her husband’s self-absorption, an index of his unreliability. But onscreen, Ms. Garner disappears more thoroughly than Mr. Cranston, and it’s frustrating rather than illuminating to see her reduced to a cipher and a symbol of someone else’s discontent.

Set almost entirely in the wilds of Montana, the film revolves around a hunting trip taken by a father, Cal (Matt Bomer), and his 14-year-old son, David (Josh Wiggins). The two have been estranged, and there’s friction between them as they reunite for a trek into the mountains.
While hiking together they tell tales and recall their pasts. But before you can say “I hope there are no bears around,” they end up sustaining injuries that force them to rely on each other as they struggle to return to civilization.
The story line is well-trod, and reminiscent in parts of “The Revenant,” “Mountain Men” and several other films that take place in rough country. Yet Mr. Bomer and Mr. Wiggins are proficient with the sparse dialogue (written by the brothers and directors Alex and Andrew Smith, from a short story by David Quammen), and with situations that are occasionally contrived.
Though it’s not high praise to describe the movie as watchable, it’s no rebuke either. The biggest stars here are the Montana locations. They are catnip to the cinematographer, Todd McMullen, who rarely misses a chance to frame the landscape at ground level and from above.

I’ll tread lightly, but I don’t think anything I say here can spoil its power.
Two groups of humans have just battled, and the victors, having slaughtered the enemy, burst into raucous cheers. It’s the kind of thing we’ve seen in movies dozens of times before: the cheapening of mass death into an easy win for the good guys. Except that in this case we, the humans in the theater seats, are not the only ones watching. A crowd of apes is also present, an emerging society whose national epic this film and its companions have marvelously and improbably become. The apes pause to witness the aftermath of the carnage they have narrowly escaped, and their wordless, shocked response, registered above all on the face of Caesar, their leader, is an eloquent rebuke to a species that has abandoned any but a biological claim to the name human.
Recall that “ape not kill ape” is the political and moral foundation of ape civilization, handed down by Caesar, their Moses, though he hasn’t always obeyed this commandment. The spectacle of people’s rejoicing in the destruction of their own kind is upsetting, and as the audience absorbs the apes’ shock, we become aware of another, deeper unease. We are now, three movies into this reborn franchise, entirely on the side of the apes. The prospect of our own extinction, far from horrifying, comes as a relief. At last the poor planet will catch a break.
Or, to put it another way, Koba was right.
If you saw “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” — the second chapter in the series so far, bridging “Rise” and “War” — you may recall that poor, abused laboratory chimp’s evolution from victim to nemesis. The damage Koba had suffered at the hands of humans made him intolerant and fanatical, an embodiment of political extremism who needed to be checked, and ultimately destroyed, by Caesar, whose political temperament tended toward moderation and compromise. Their conflict was mirrored by a struggle on the human side between a genocidal, ape-hating military commander and a rival leader who believed in coexistence.
“Dawn,” like “Rise” before it, rested on a hopeful, slightly hokey message of interspecies harmony. In spite of their differences and mutual suspicions, maybe the two primate societies, one coalescing while the other slid toward chaos, could share the Earth, or at least the stretch of Northern California forest where this franchise plants its allegorical flag.
Times change. “War for the Planet of the Apes,” directed by Matt Reeves, is the grimmest episode so far, and also the strongest, a superb example — rare in this era of sloppily constructed, commercially hedged cinematic universes — of clear thinking wedded to inventive technique in popular filmmaking. The distinction of this run of “Planet of the Apes” movies has been its commitment to the venerable belief that science fiction belongs to the literature of ideas, and its willingness to risk seeming to take itself too seriously. Each episode has pursued a stark ethical or political problem, and each has shifted the moral ground from human to ape.
“Rise” was about how people treat and mistreat animals, about the tension between recognizing them as sentient beings and the long habit of exploiting and confining them. “Dawn” was a wishful parable of decolonization and counterinsurgency, concerned with the competing but equally legitimate claims of two tribes occupying adjacent territory. “War” — which, in spite of its title, is less a war film than a western wrapped around a prison movie — vindicates Koba’s view of humanity as irredeemably cruel and deceitful.
The memory of Koba’s own treachery is kept alive, as some of his followers have drifted from militant anti-Caesarism to collaboration with the enemy species. There is a new nemesis in town, a renegade colonel played by Woody Harrelson, who goes full Heart of Darkness, staging a one-man remake of “Apocalypse Now” in a medical base he has refashioned into a concentration camp. He has Marlon Brando’s clean-shaven dome, Robert Duvall’s mirrored sunglasses and Dennis Hopper’s manic verbosity. The horror! The horror!
Really, though, it’s a lot of fun, in spite of the somber picture I’ve been painting. Mr. Reeves, who also directed “Dawn,” has a dark vision, but also a light touch when necessary, and, above all, a commitment to creating a world that is coherent as well as fantastical. This world is also intensely and somewhat unimaginatively masculine. The default setting for primate social organization in these movies, human and otherwise, is patriarchal, and while a few female apes and a young human girl appear on screen, the filmmakers’ inability to flesh out the familial and affective dimensions of an otherwise richly rendered reality is frustrating.
But still, the motion-captured, digitally sculpted apes are so natural, so expressive, so beautifully integrated into their environment, that you almost forget to be astonished by the nuances of thought and emotion that flicker across their faces, often seen in close-up. Andy Serkis’s performance as Caesar is one of the marvels of modern screen acting, and it’s complemented by those of Karin Konoval, reprising her role as the wise orangutan Maurice, and Steve Zahn, as a sad-clown sidekick named Bad Ape.
Caesar and Maurice communicate in primitive English and sign language, and for long stretches their adventures unfold without much human interaction, though they do adopt a mute human orphan (Amiah Miller) shortly before they meet Bad Ape. Our ilk is in a bad way, and not only because of the fanatical, desperate militarism represented by the Colonel. A new strain of virus is robbing people of their ability to speak, accelerating a reversal of species hierarchy set in motion two movies ago when Caesar first howled the word “no.”
He is a grayer, sadder hero now, and in “War” he succumbs for a while to a vengeful impulse at odds with his essential high-mindedness. You could say that he is putting his humanity at risk, or that he’s only human, after all, but of course both descriptions would be absurd. We’ll have to come up with a new vocabulary, but while we still have this one — and while flesh-and-blood people are still directing digital gorillas and chimps — I’ll just say that it’s good to see a movie so thoroughly humane." 0.999839619 "Action" "PG-13" "Fox" "$150,000,000 " "$56,262,929 " "$146,880,162 " "" "1,859" "24-Jun-94" "" "" NA

The movie finds young adults, a brother and sister (Diego Gamaliel and Maria Evoli), coming upon and forming an alliance with a hermit (Noé Hernández) in a vacant apartment building.
Incest, menstrual-blood play, torture and cannibalism ensue. The Mexican national anthem is sung by the characters during a particularly fraught sequence, to let you know that the whole thing is a metaphor.

Pier Paolo Pasolini and Catherine Breillat are other apparent reference points, but those artists, for all their sophistication, produced work seemingly animated by raw anger. “We Are the Flesh,” its abundance of repellent imagery notwithstanding, has an air of the academic about it.

Mr. Rocha Minter, who is in his 20s, has obvious filmmaking talent, but he is also, to judge by this evidence, a sensationalist dilettante with a mean streak.

Then there’s the proprietor of a coffee shop who can’t seem to keep his mind on his business, and a server at said coffee shop, who may or may not be the proprietor’s mistress — but who definitely has an amorous interest in the playwright.
The setup and characters are a little reminiscent of a film by the Korean anatomist of bad romance Hong Sang-soo. But this isn’t any such thing.
“Wet Woman in the Wind,” directed by Akihiko Shiota, is more concerned with sex than sexual neuroses. The movie is one of several recent postmodern reboots of what has been called “roman porno,” a subgenre of erotic cinema that was very popular in Japan in the 1970s and ’80s. These were cheaply made soft-core pictures that could get away with a lot of aesthetic quirkiness, on account of also featuring images of half-naked women like clockwork. Nikkatsu, the studio that pioneered the form, is now commissioning new films as a kind of cheeky self-homage.
But let’s make no bones about it: This is a film designed to appeal to straight male prurient interest. Yuki Mamiya, who plays Shiori, the title character, has a smoldering quality that fills the bill. Much less winning is the way the movie treats consent, as in the playwright’s rough “seduction” of a very young fan. Genre homage or not, trashy, assault-coddling sexism is a turn off — and worse.

And given that the original “Whisky Galore!” — Alexander Mackendrick’s warmly funny 1949 tale of fictional Hebridean islanders driven to lawlessness after their wartime ration of whisky runs out — is well nigh unimprovable, the director Gillies MacKinnon has his work cut out.
Beyond simple nostalgia, though, the appeal of this limp retread is difficult to discern. Peter McDougall’s screenplay (once again based on the novel by Compton Mackenzie, which in turn was inspired by a 1941 shipwreck in the Outer Hebrides) resurrects key plot points without any obvious attempt to refresh or modernize. References to the Raj and Wallis Simpson might have slayed in 1949, but 21st-century audiences are unlikely to get the joke.
As Macroon, the film’s narrator and the island’s widowed postmaster, Gregor Fisher leads a cast that’s ill-served by the musty script. Whether rushing to salvage the cases of Scotch newly liberated from a foundering cargo ship, or scrambling to hide their spoils from a bumbling Home Guard captain (Eddie Izzard, creamy English vowels at the ready), the islanders are as uninteresting as Macroon’s woolly cardigans.
Filmed on the northern coast of Aberdeenshire, “Whisky Galore!” — unlike the liquid it lusts after — is dry, dull and without kick or color.

Its directors, Sabaah Folayan and Damon Davis, are novice filmmakers, true; but I also suspect this movie’s form is deliberate, part of its message. This is direct and frequently powerful filmmaking that doesn’t much care about meeting my aesthetic standards.
“Whose Streets?” takes off from the night Mr. Brown was shot. One of the movie’s subjects is David Whitt, a resident of the apartment complex on the street where the shooting took place, who is moved to take his video camera onto the streets to record police action as rioting started. Another thread follows Brittany Ferrell and Alexis Templeton, a couple navigating parenthood and school, and putting themselves at considerable risk as they lead and participate in demonstrations like one in which they formed a human chain to block traffic on a highway.
The movie is punctuated with quotes by black historical figures — Martin Luther King Jr.’s observation that “a riot is the language of the unheard” is particularly resonant. Much of the footage is from low-resolution video cameras and cellphones; the most professional-looking material here is from a television interview with Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Mr. Brown, in which he says, “You can’t perform the duties of a police officer and have racism in you.” This is shown in the same section that features on-the-fly shots of off-duty St. Louis police officers puffing their chests at activists at a town hall meeting. Another wrenching scene shows a protester trying to address a black female officer, the only person of color in a defensive line of cops; she holds her position even as tears fill her eyes." 0.648160988 "Documentary" "R" "Magnolia" "" "$43,804 " "$182,799 " "" "32" "14-Mar-14" "15-May-14" "63" 9

He is furiously disdainful of most of the people he meets, but also has a habit of sidling up to them and initiating awkward conversations with a smile halfway between a snarl and a leer. Humanity annoys him, and he’s happy to return the favor.
Which makes him, on paper, an intriguing character. By “on paper” I mean, specifically, in the pages of Daniel Clowes’s graphic novel “Wilson,” a funny-sad, episodic portrait of everyday loneliness and longing. American literature — and American comic-book literature in particular — hardly lacks for disaffected, middle-age white guys, but Wilson has his own special brand of abrasive charm.
Not onscreen, though. The movie version of “Wilson,” directed by Craig Johnson (“The Skeleton Twins”) from a screenplay by Mr. Clowes, illustrates the difficulty of translating an idiosyncratic temperament from one visual medium to another. The dark, comic poignancy of the book is drowned in garish, self-conscious whimsy, and the work of a talented ensemble is squandered on awkward heartstring snatching.
Wide-eyed and gaptoothed, with heavy-framed glasses and a copper-and-silver beard, Woody Harrelson plays Wilson as a kinetic ball of conflicting impulses. He’s unpleasant, but not in an especially interesting way, and ingratiating in a way that’s even drearier. The other people in Wilson’s life — his foils, enablers and marks — are played by capable actors. Laura Dern is his wayward ex-wife, Pippi. Cheryl Hines is her judgy sister, Polly. Judy Greer is Wilson’s dog-sitter, and Isabella Amara is the almost-grown daughter he never knew he had. Mary Lynn Rajskub and the character actress Margo Martindale each have a few minutes of screen time.
As is often the case with well-intentioned, misbegotten projects, you’re happy to see them even as you wonder how they ended up here. The same is true of the composer Jon Brion, a usually brilliant musical artist whose score in this case is an unpalatable cocktail of jauntiness and melodrama, swamping the action rather than complementing it.

The juxtaposition of the imagery and the poetics make for a peculiar opening. Eventually it all makes tragic sense.
Here, Jeremy Renner plays Cory Lambert, a federal wildlife officer who hunts predatory animals at the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. He seems on intimate terms with the residents there; his ex-wife, with whom he has a young son and had a daughter, is a Native American with family on the reservation. While searching for a mountain lion that has been attacking livestock, he finds a corpse frozen in the mountain snow. The dead young woman, who suffered a head injury and was also raped, was the best friend of Cory’s daughter, who died three years earlier under similar circumstances.
Homicide on an Indian reservation, as it happens, is a federal crime. The F.B.I. — which, going by the attitude of the reservation’s quiet police chief, is consistently less helpful than it should be — dispatches Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), a seemingly very green agent, to head the investigation. She shows up wearing an F.B.I. windbreaker, and Cory calmly informs her that she’ll be dead within five minutes if she goes up the mountain dressed like that.
“See what they send us,” one resident says mournfully, shaking his head. In a different movie, the introduction of Jane and Cory would be a meet-cute. But Mr. Sheridan, who also avoided injecting a romantic theme into his script for “Sicario,” in which Emily Blunt played an F.B.I. operative, has different, more serious reasons for making this character a woman. Jane acts partly as an audience surrogate, a well-intentioned outsider whose empathy and sincere desire to act on behalf of the female murder victim only gets her so far.
The case lights up a cold fury in Cory. He reassures the victim’s father, “I’m a hunter.” He demonstrates to Jane that in this terrain, it’s the landscape that will yield the most important answers, not the frequently recalcitrant Indians whom Jane wants to interview. He’s right, of course, and his wisdom is borne out in some gut-wrenching ways.
Under David Mackenzie’s direction, “Hell or High Water” tended to overstate its hard-times-in-the-United-States theme; it seemed that every fifth shot or so showed a house foreclosure sale sign or a bankruptcy lawyer’s billboard. As a director, Mr. Sheridan is a little more subtle than Mr. Mackenzie. This is kind of surprising; frequently, writers turned directors really like to bring the hammer down on their subtexts. But Mr. Sheridan limits himself to one shot of an American flag being flown upside down. Other than that, he lets the terrible situation on the reservation speak for itself. An actor before he was a screenwriter, Mr. Sheridan clearly spent a lot of his time learning about filmmaking on movie sets; his direction is assured throughout. A standoff scene near the movie’s finale would not be shamed if put next to one of Michael Mann’s better set pieces.
The performances Mr. Sheridan draws from his cast are all excellent. Mr. Renner, who’s been spending too much of his career imparting convincing humanity to a second-tier Marvel superhero, is in excellent form as Cory. Ms. Olsen, who has been co-starring in those Marvel films with Mr. Renner, is sympathetic as Jane. Graham Greene brings his customary quiet power and dry wit to the role of the police chief.
The movie builds to a shocking climax, even though the revelation of the bad guys makes immediate, sickening sense. The film’s ultimate statement sinks in later, with an expanded awareness that the justice done by the good guys in this film is not nearly sufficient with respect to the larger injustice done to Native Americans." 0.988745723 "Action" "R" "Weinstein Company" "$11,000,000 " "" "$33,800,859 " "" "944" "7-Aug-87" "" "" NA

Embarrassed by her Dumpster-diving father (Ryan Phillippe) and hounded by the resident high school meanie, Clare wishes only to be rich, popular and adored by her hunky crush. Maybe this funny-looking music box covered in Chinese characters can help?
As directed by John R. Leonetti, “Wish Upon” would rather make you jump than gag. The splatter is deployed cautiously and sometimes wittily, the story moving briskly from wishes granted to costs exacted with the help of familiar faces (including a warm Sherilyn Fenn as Clare’s surrogate mother) and a sympathetic lead. Pressing gently on the bruise of a broken home to explain Clare’s addiction to the evil receptacle (in a move that recalls “The Possession” a few years back), Barbara Marshall’s zippy script cuts corners without severing its bond to Clare’s emotions.

Anthony (Taylor John Smith) is a basketball star at a private high school in New York who is good enough to be drawing interest from Cornell. The league championship game is looming, but Anthony has distractions, many of them caused by his father (Michael Shannon), whose drinking and gambling are spiraling out of control.
This is stock plotting — the athlete sidetracked by domestic matters at a crucial moment — but Mr. Smith and especially Mr. Shannon sell the conceit well, aided by fine performances from Carla Gugino as Anthony’s mother and Zazie Beetz as his girlfriend. Yet just when the film seems as if it will choose the road rarely taken by movies involving sports — the subtle road, the one that doesn’t involve last-second heroics on the court or diamond or field — Mr. Freundlich veers into thudding excess.

When the helmet is removed, we know how he knows what he knows: His young face is scarred, his earlobes are little flaps and his eyes are seemingly tear-shaped, giving him a perpetual sad-puppy expression.
The good-natured fellow describes his facial birth defects, and the 27 operations he’s endured to deal with them, as “hilarious.” But Auggie is less amused by the prospect of entering the fifth grade, and no longer being home-schooled by his brilliant and loving mother, Isabel Pullman (Julia Roberts).
The Pullmans are an upper-middle-class family living in a fairy-tale New York, one that the film’s location manager conjured up from the most genteel corners of Brooklyn and Manhattan (as well as New Westminster, British Columbia, where the interior of the family’s brownstone was built on a warehouse stage). So Auggie, whose father, Nate (Owen Wilson), has a job that lets him wear a suit and sneakers, is certainly going to a good school. Nonetheless, he knows that he will encounter bullies, and he does. But Auggie is smart, clever and exceptionally good-hearted (at least when he is not being made to feel self-conscious and alone), and has a knack for winning people over.
The movie, based on the popular children’s novel by R.J. Palacio, hews to the book’s multicharacter narration structure. This tactic reminded me of a line in Jean Renoir’s classic “The Rules of the Game” about everybody having their own reasons for their behavior. In Renoir’s movie, that fact is called a “truly terrible thing.” In the world of this film, understanding another person’s reasons is the first step in establishing meaningful communication. During the section of the film narrated by Auggie’s older sister, Via (Izabela Vidovic), you learn why, in an awkward first conversation with her future boyfriend, she impulsively tells him that she’s an only child, despite the fact that she loves and ardently protects her little brother.
Directed by Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the screenplay with Steve Conrad and Jack Thorne, the movie has a cast that’s wonderful from top to bottom. As Auggie’s parents, Ms. Roberts and Mr. Wilson are doing things we love to see those actors doing. (Ms. Roberts lets loose with her trademark ebullient laugh at least once, and Mr. Wilson explains life’s issues to Auggie in a droll drawl.) All the young people in the ensemble, anchored by Mr. Tremblay’s Auggie, are perfect.
“Wonder” is that rare thing, a family picture that moves and amuses while never overtly pandering. Mr. Chbosky’s 2012 feature, “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” split the difference between the sentimental heart-tugging associated with more standard Hollywood fare, and the intelligence and intimacy often associated with independent films.

It tells the story of a desperately, unhappily married woman whose affair with a local Romeo is derailed when he takes notice of her stepdaughter, whose breasts have been lit to glow like Vermeer peaches. The heart wants what it wants, as Mr. Allen once said by way of explaining his affair with his now wife, Soon-Yi, the daughter of his longtime ex, Mia Farrow. I tend to think it’s a bad idea to put a movie on the couch, but what if it climbs on the couch and then starts winking?
“Wonder Wheel” returns Mr. Allen to Coney Island, the childhood home of his alter ego Alvy Singer, the narrator of “Annie Hall” who claims to have grown up under the amusement park’s roller coaster. (“I have some trouble between fantasy and reality,” Alvy says.) In “Wonder Wheel,” the sad wife, Ginny (Kate Winslet), lives in an apartment that looks directly onto the park’s looming Ferris wheel. The attraction obscures her view of the ocean, literalizing already narrow horizons, and casts deep, expressionistic blue and red light on the apartment’s dilapidated interior and its equally worn inhabitants.
Ginny isn’t all used up, despite the insistently unflattering way she is often presented. She winces and frowns a lot, and the camera conspires with the lighting and makeup to catch every twitch of distress, and the sweaty, oily sheen she never seems able to blot away. It’s no surprise that she’s worried. She works in a clam house on the boardwalk, scrambling for hoi polloi, while back at home she has to juggle her loud, loutish husband, Humpty (Jim Belushi), and her son, Richie (Jack Gore). Like the young Alvy in “Annie Hall,” Richie is a redhead. But while Alvy is depressed about the universe, Richie seems largely troubled by his home life, specifically his demonstrably miserable mother.
So, when Mickey (Justin Timberlake, too modern a presence), a lifeguard and self-described romantic, gives Ginny the once over, she gratefully falls into his arms. “Wonder Wheel” more or less becomes Ginny’s story, but she doesn’t get to own it. The movie is narrated by Mickey, who pops in and out and looks directly into the camera. He has literary ambitions, as he likes to remind us, as well as a pad in Greenwich Village. For a while, Mickey offers Ginny a respite from her everyday grind, at least until the arrival of Carolina (a fine Juno Temple), Humpty’s daughter from an earlier marriage. She’s on the run from her gangster husband. “I know where all the bodies are buried,” Carolina says.
Somewhat of a cultural magpie, Mr. Allen has often folded bits and pieces — and at times entire conceits — from other work into his movies. Mickey mentions Eugene O’Neill, a reference that suggests we’re meant to see something of that playwright in Ginny and Humpty at their most raw and boozily fraught. Mr. Allen’s often blunt, overwrought dialogue, however, also alternately brings to mind Budd Schulberg (“I coulda been a contender”) and imitation Clifford Odets. In some scenes, you almost expect Mr. Belushi, who’s playing his heart out, to start bellowing about someone named Lefty. Much like its gaudy title attraction, “Wonder Wheel” keeps on turning, even while going nowhere.
This is Mr. Allen’s second movie with the cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, who seems to have enjoyed taking the color wheel and camera out for a spin. He gives the story visual flow, even when the characters are in claustrophobic lockdown. And Mr. Storaro keeps your pupils dancing with the light and dark hues. Some of the establishing shots of Coney Island recall the softer side of Technicolor, whereas the violently saturated scenes suggest the vibrancy of the Blue Rider palette. The more extreme colors — including an unlovely orange light that floods Ginny — pushes the whole thing into expressionism even as the movie fluctuates between kitchen-sink realism and hothouse melodrama.
Mr. Allen certainly keeps you busy with all these colors, tones, influences, complications, stereotypes and histrionics, but to little end. As has always been the case with his movies, the actors seem to have delivered the performances they came to the set with, so the strong — in this case, the invaluable Ms. Winslet — are strong while the rest of the cast members do what they can with varying degrees of success. Ginny, who yearns for something better than clam houses and brutality — and who is mercilessly punished for her yearning — could easily have become a monstrous, one-note cliché. But Ms. Winslet fills this shabby character with feverish life. She conveys far more with a single, quietly stunned look than any of Mr. Allen’s speeches or Mr. Storaro’s color changes.
At one point, after Ginny has turned into Blanche DuBois, she announces, “When it comes to love we often turn out to be our own worst enemy.” And not for the first time you wonder what Mr. Allen, who has long blurred fact and fiction, thinks he’s doing here. He couldn’t have anticipated that his name would be in the news because of the allegations of sexual abuse upending the entertainment industry. Yet how could we not think of him? In 1993, he was accused of molesting his daughter, Dylan Farrow. He maintained his innocence and was never prosecuted, yet the allegations as well as discomfort about his marriage to Soon-Yi have hovered over him like a malignant cloud. Critics have often uneasily ignored his history, but he himself seems perversely intent on invoking it." 0.675394155 "Drama" "PG-13" "Amazon Studios" "" "$125,570 " "$1,401,853 " "" "4" "16-Aug-13" "19-Sep-13" "35" 5

Once franchise continuity is established — a mysterious package from Bruce Wayne arrives at the office of Wonder Woman’s alter ego, Diana Prince, who works in the Louvre’s antiquities department — we are transported back to the heroine’s earlier life, long before she became mixed up with Wayne and Clark Kent. “Wonder Woman,” directed by Patty Jenkins from a script by Allan Heinberg, briskly shakes off blockbuster branding imperatives and allows itself to be something relatively rare in the modern superhero cosmos. It feels less like yet another installment in an endless sequence of apocalyptic merchandising opportunities than like … what’s the word I’m looking for? A movie. A pretty good one, too.
By which I mean that “Wonder Woman” tells an interesting, not entirely predictable story (until the climax, which reverts, inevitably and disappointingly, to dreary, overblown action clichés). It cleverly combines genre elements into something reasonably fresh, touching and fun. Its earnest insouciance recalls the “Superman” movies of the ’70s and ’80s more than the mock-Wagnerian spectacles of our own day, and like those predigital Man of Steel adventures, it gestures knowingly but reverently back to the jaunty, truth-and-justice spirit of an even older Hollywood tradition.
This is an origin story, first and foremost, establishing the mythic background and modern mission of its main character. That kind of movie can be tedious, but “Wonder Woman” is leavened by touches of screwball comedy, espionage caper and romantic adventure, as well as by what might be the most credible superhero screen kiss since upside-down Tobey Maguire planted one on Kirsten Dunst way back in “Spider-Man.”
But I’m getting ahead of myself. Diana Prince is, properly speaking, Princess Diana, daughter of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons (Connie Nielsen). The girl (played in childhood by Lilly Aspell and Emily Carey before maturing into Gal Gadot) grows up on a craggy Mediterranean island, a Bechdel-test paradise of flower-strewn meadows, noble horses and mighty quadriceps. Like a Disney princess — the resemblance hardly seems accidental — she is free-spirited and rebellious, her loyalties split between two opposed parental figures. Diana’s mother wants her daughter to mind her tutors and steer clear of the warrior traditions represented by Antiope (Robin Wright), the girl’s aunt.
In the course of family arguments about Diana’s destiny, the history of the Amazons is recounted, with emphasis on that tribe’s ambivalent relations with men — meaning human beings generically and dudes in particular. There are none of the latter on the island, which has been sealed off from history and the rest of the world by a magic membrane. And then one day a screaming comes across the sky, and a World War I vintage fighter plane disgorges Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), a blue-eyed flyboy who is the living embodiment of the phrase “not all men.”
Steve, a spy for the Allies, is wearing a German uniform and is pursued by a flotilla of Teutonic bad guys, who battle the Amazons on the beach. The action hops to London and then to the trenches of Belgium, where the War to End All Wars slogs interminably on. There are fistfights in alleys and more extensive episodes of combat, during which Diana makes use of her aunt’s training, traditional Amazon weapons (notably a glowing piece of rope called the Lasso of Truth) and her own unique abilities. She deflects bullets and mortar shells on a sprint across no-man’s land, tosses an armored truck and demolishes a church steeple.
Even better, she is a glamorous and funny fish out of water. Diana and Steve are assisted in their mission by a quartet of misfit sidekicks: a Scottish sharpshooter (Ewen Bremner); a Native American scout (Eugene Brave Rock); a Middle Eastern fixer (Said Taghmaoui) and a plucky British suffragist (Lucy Davis). The field of possible supervillains includes Danny Huston as a German commander and Elena Anaya as a diabolical chemist. The great David Thewlis is on hand doing some of the things you might expect and also some things you might not.
But make no mistake: This is a star vehicle all the way. Ms. Gadot, who like the other Amazons speaks English with an accent (though hers, unlike Ms. Wright’s or Ms. Nielsen’s, may be a result of her Israeli background), has a regal, effortlessly charismatic screen presence. She and Mr. Pine, who has Paul Newman’s seductive blue eyes and a hint of Clark Gable’s raffish charm, give “Wonder Woman” a jolt of classic Hollywood fizz. Their banter, long before that kiss, is lively and sexy, and their oil-and-water temperaments emulsify nicely.
Ms. Jenkins and Mr. Heinberg have synthesized a plausible modern archetype out of comic-book and movie sources that may have seemed problematic to modern sensibilities. Diana is erudite but unworldly, witty but never ironic, supremely self-confident and utterly mystified by the modern world. Its capacity for cruelty is a perpetual shock to her, even though she herself is a prodigy of violence. Her sacred duty is to bring peace to the world. Accomplishing it requires a lot of killing, but that’s always the superhero paradox.
“Wonder Woman,” though, resists the reflexive power-worship that drags so many superhero movies — from the Marvel as well as the DC universes — into the mire of pseudo-Nietzschean adolescent posturing. Unlike most of her male counterparts, its heroine is not trying to exorcise inner demons or work out messiah issues. She wants to function freely in the world, to help out when needed and to be respected for her abilities. No wonder she encounters so much resistance." 0.965885716 "Action" "PG-13" "Warner Bros."

"353" "Wonderstruck" "10/20/2017" "10/19/2017" "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/wonderstruck-review-todd-haynes.html" 1 "Stars glitter and worlds collide in Todd Haynes’s “Wonderstruck,” a lovely ode to imagination and to the stories that make us who we are. A cleverly bifurcated tale of two children, it starts in 1977 with Ben (Oakes Fegley), a boy of about 10 in rural Minnesota. He’s in mourning for his mother (Michelle Williams in flashback) and has a question mark — an absent father — that needs solving. First, though, there’s David Bowie on the turntable (“ground control to Major Tom”) and a lightning strike that leaves Ben deaf. Fearless and resourceful, Ben splits for New York to find his father.
Ben’s story-twin, whose life and adventures curiously mirror his own, is Rose (Millicent Simmonds, a discovery), a 12-year-old deaf girl in 1927 who yearns to escape her lonely, cosseted life in Hoboken, N.J. To that end, following in the footsteps of countless other dreamers, she, too, flees to New York. There, she seeks out her absent mother, but instead finds a cipher (Julianne Moore), a screen star who clutches fictional babes to her breast but has no time for life’s real lost children. As undaunted and determined as Ben, Rose sets off again, entering a world thrumming with coincidences and complications.
Despite the distinct periods and palettes — Ben’s story unfolds in color, Rose’s in black and white — the story, the editing and the children’s deafness underscore that these two are deeply connected. The film’s mysteries include how and why they fit, and its satisfactions involve seeing where the scattered bread crumbs lead. How, for instance, an Oscar Wilde line in Ben’s room — “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars” — fits into the larger puzzle. And why, after Ben asks his mother about his father, the film shifts to a plaintive Rose, who’s looking at a movie-magazine ad trumpeting “Our Brightest Stars.” Both that  Wilde epigram and Rose’s film fandom are hints, clues in a story that eventually dovetails with Mr. Haynes’s interest in images and identity.
“Wonderstruck” is based on a hefty, generously illustrated children’s book by Brian Selznick, best known for “The Invention of Hugo Cabret.” Martin Scorsese turned that book into “Hugo,” a reverie about movie love that also features dead parents, a grave if pluckily resourceful child, many whirring yet connected parts and a preoccupation with the cinematic. The film version of “Wonderstruck” draws from much the same overflowing treasure-trove of ideas, although Mr. Haynes (like Mr. Scorsese) often feels most energized by the many different ways human beings — with cinematic sights and sounds, through wall shadows and painstaking miniatures — put the world in a box.
Both Rose and Ben fantasize about escaping their lives, but they need a little push, inspiration. Storytelling lies at the heart of “Wonderstruck” — its two children are effectively writing their way out of one reality and into another — and the film is chockablock with those boxed worlds, with imitations of life like dioramas, doll-size figurines, stuffed animals, illustrations and an ingenious paper city. Much like the cabinet of curiosities that Rose and Ben each discover, these representations point to new worlds and alternative realities. And, as they pile up, Mr. Haynes joins the story’s halves with craft and wit. Rose’s half isn’t just in black and white, it also emotionally and gesturally recalls a late-period silent film; Ben’s, by contrast, has the rough textures and bleeding colors that summon 1970s big-screen New York.
Although the film follows the novel fairly closely — Mr. Selznick wrote the script — it nevertheless is very much a Todd Haynes production. Its ideas feel pitched to an older audience, for one, and its emotional temperature is cooler than that of Mr. Selznick’s book, which is soon splashed in tears as Ben’s terror gives way to anguish about his mother. Mr. Haynes is happy to set a wolf after Ben in the woods, a jaggedly shot chase bathed in midnight blue, but he refrains from easy sentimentalism. (The director of photography is Ed Lachman.) As a filmmaker, Mr. Haynes prefers appealing to our heads over tugging at our hearts, and so for a while he keeps you at an intellectual remove.
Part of the pleasure of Mr. Haynes’s films — which include “I’m Not There” and “Carol” — is how he deploys intellectual distance as he plays with cinematic form, considers identity and upends clichés. Elsewhere, this can come across as dreary, even programmatic. Yet because Mr. Haynes also leads with his characters rather than his ideas, his films gather force until, at times with near-violent suddenness, they become devastatingly, skin-prickingly alive. In Mr. Haynes’s “Far From Heaven,” his combination of playfulness and seriousness translates into a homage to Sirkian melodrama that turns into a thrilling example of the very same. And, in “Wonderstruck,” a children’s story about finding your place in the world, in time becomes a Haynesian exploration of identity, desire and imagination.
“Wonderstruck” takes a while to find its groove, but it gets there. Mr. Haynes’s oscillation between the story’s two halves is gracefully handled (the editor is Affonso Gonçalves), but it can create a frustrating sense of narrative interruptus. That’s particularly true because it’s hard not to miss Rose when Ben is onscreen. Part of this has to do with the charming exoticism of her old-time world with its winking artifice and cinematic allusions. Ben’s half has its attractions, including his new pal (Jaden Michael) and the sun-blasted vision of a broiling New York summer. But it’s also the section in which the machinery of Mr. Selznick’s storytelling, with its mysticism and coincidences, creaks the loudest.
Mr. Selznick’s emphasis on wonder — represented by the story’s surfeit of enchantments and the near-miraculously fitted parts — can feel bullying, as if he were demanding delight instead of earning it. Yet even as he follows Mr. Selznick’s narrative lead, Mr. Haynes quietly and touchingly makes “Wonderstruck” his own because the wonder of the film isn’t in its story but in its telling. It’s in the expressive beauty of his images, the expansiveness of his ideas and the way he naturally, generously brings a once-upon-a-time girl and boy to life, allowing them to find themselves — in their willfulness, their heartbreaks and their imaginings — so that eventually they can find someone else." 0.999906377 "Drama" "PG" "Roadside Attractions" "" "$65,882 " "$1,060,377 " "" "2" "12-Jul-13" "6-Mar-14" "112" 16

Oh, it’s pretty enough, in the superficially embellished style of a perfume ad or fashion video — the gifted Finnish cinematographer Peter Flinckenberg virtually empties his bag of tricks. But it’s more lacking in substance than a yard of silk chiffon.
The title refers to the psychological panic engendered by being lost in a forest (here played by the giant redwoods in Humboldt County, California), but Theresa (Kirsten Dunst) isn’t physically disoriented, just mentally unmoored. Having helped her sick mother die using a spiked spliff, Theresa, who works in a medical-marijuana dispensary, descends into a detached reverie of hallucinatory grief. Neither her boyfriend (Joe Cole, underemployed to the point of effacement) nor her boss (a miscast Pilou Asbaek) can reach her.
What follows is less a consideration of the fallout from an act of euthanasia than a succession of disjointed, dreamlike scenes of Theresa listlessly caressing tree trunks and her mother’s shabby-chic furnishings. More than one person will die as she continues to mope and medicate, attired in a succession of lace-trimmed chemises. Yet no substantive conversation or hint of greater meaning pierces this gauzy void, which the Mulleavy sisters, whose fashion label is Rodarte, decorate by slapping butterflies or flowers on virtually every available surface.
Filmmaking might be a natural sidestep for fashion designers — as Tom Ford has twice proven, though he had the foresight to use strong novels as building blocks — but “Woodshock” is a painterly bore. At their most basic level, movies are supposed to actually move; this one is as becalmed as its perpetually high heroine." 0.061654642 "Drama" "R" "A24" "" "$12,247 " "$42,603 " "" "31" "3-Nov-17" "14-Dec-17" "42" 6

At their son’s wedding, she learns that Robin has accepted a job transfer from the East Coast to Wichita, Kan. He hasn’t bothered to consult Joan at all, assuming she will tag along.
Later, in bed, Robin, played with brisk pretensions of authority by Michael Cristofer, shrugs off her concerns with something like contempt. At the end of their argument, Joan, played by Karen Allen with patience and precision, asks, “Why do you love me?” Mishearing, he says “Yes.” When she repeats the question, he responds, “Because you’re my wife. Men love their wives.” Twisting his knife, he finishes, “And their mothers.”
Here, what seemed to Joan like a good marriage unveils itself as something wholly other. The movie deliberately descends from this brutal height to something friendlier, more encouraging and, alas, substantially more quaint.
Based on a memoir by Joan Anderson, “Year by the Sea” depicts Joan taking up solo residence in Cape Cod, in search of self-realization. After meeting an array of droll locals, she encounters a woman (Celia Imrie), a dancer and the wife of the pioneering psychoanalyst Erik Erikson — who, among other things, coined the term “identity crisis.” .
The writer-director Alexander Janko is also a composer, and he leavens the movie’s anecdotal structure with airs designed to enhance aperçus like “From adversity comes transcendence.” The movie is not entirely my cup of tea, although it is refreshing in its depiction of diverse, older female characters (including Joan’s quirky literary agent, played by S. Epatha Merkerson). The pleasure of Joan’s screen company is not insubstantial." 0.451245301 "Comedy" "Unrated" "Real Women" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" NA
